Abstract#==#Query auto completion (QAC) systems are a standard part of search engines in
industry, helping users formulate their query. Such systems update their
suggestions after the user types each character, predicting the user's intent
using various signals â€“ one of the most common being popularity. Recently,
deep learning approaches have been proposed for the QAC task, to specifically
address the main limitation of previous popularity-based methods: the inability
to predict unseen queries. In this work we improve previous methods based on
neural language modeling, with the goal of building an end-to-end system. We
particularly focus on using real-world data by integrating user information for
personalized suggestions when possible. We also make use of time information
and study how to increase diversity in the suggestions while studying the
impact on scalability. Our empirical results demonstrate a marked improvement
on two separate datasets over previous best methods in both accuracy and
scalability, making a step towards neural query auto-completion in production
search engines.
