Abstract#==#This paper introduces a meaning representation for spoken language understanding.
The Alexa meaning representation language (AMRL), unlike previous approaches, which factor spoken utterances into domains, provides a common representation for how people communicate in spoken language. AMRL is a rooted graph, links to a large-scale ontology, supports cross-domain queries, fine-grained types, complex utterances and composition. A spoken language dataset has been collected for Alexa, which contains âˆ¼20k examples across eight domains. A version of this meaning representation was released to developers at a trade show in 2016.
