Abstract#==#Intelligent personal digital assistants (IPDAs), a popular real-life
application with spoken language understanding capabilities, can cover
potentially thousands of overlapping domains for natural language
understanding, and the task of finding the best domain to handle an utterance
becomes a challenging problem on a large scale. In this paper, we propose a set
of efficient and scalable shortlisting-reranking neural models for effective
large-scale domain classification for IPDAs. The shortlisting stage focuses on
efficiently trimming all domains down to a list of k-best candidate domains,
and the reranking stage performs a list-wise reranking of the initial k-best
domains with additional contextual information. We show the effectiveness of
our approach with extensive experiments on 1,500 IPDA domains.
