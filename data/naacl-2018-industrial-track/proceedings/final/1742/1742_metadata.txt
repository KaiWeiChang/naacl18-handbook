Abstract#==#The overwhelming success of the Web and mobile technologies has enabled
millions to share their opinions publicly at any time. But the same success
also endangers this freedom of speech due to closing down of participatory
sites misused by individuals or interest groups. We propose to support manual
moderation by proactively drawing the attention of our moderators to article
discussions that most likely need their intervention. To this end, we predict
which articles will receive a high number of comments. In contrast to existing
work, we enrich the article with metadata, extract semantic and linguistic
features, and exploit annotated data from a foreign language corpus. Our
logistic regression model improves F1-scores by over 80% in comparison to
state-of-the-art approaches.
