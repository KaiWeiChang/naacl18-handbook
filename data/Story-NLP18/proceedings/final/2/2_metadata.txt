Abstract#==#We examine an emerging NLP application that supports creative writing by automatically suggesting continuing sentences in a story. The application tracks users' modifications to generated sentences, which can be used to quantify their "helpfulness" in advancing the story. We explore the task of predicting helpfulness based on automatically detected linguistic features of the suggestions. We illustrate this analysis on a set of user interactions with the application using an initial selection of features relevant to story generation.
