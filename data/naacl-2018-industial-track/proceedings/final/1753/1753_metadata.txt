Abstract#==#To  provide  better access of the inventory to buyers and better search engine
optimization, e-Commerce websites are automatically generating millions of
browse pages. A browse page consists of a set of slot name/value pairs within a
given category, grouping multiple items which share some characteristics. These
browse pages require a title describing the content of the page. Since the
number of browse pages are huge, manual  creation of these titles is
infeasible. Previous statistical and neural approaches depend heavily on the
availability of large amounts of data in a language. In this research, we apply
sequence-to-sequence models to generate titles for high-resource as well as
low-resource languages by leveraging transfer  learning. We train these models
on multi-lingual data, thereby creating one joint model which can generate
titles in various different languages. Performance of the title generation
system is evaluated on three different languages; English, German, and French,
with a particular  focus on low-resourced French language.
