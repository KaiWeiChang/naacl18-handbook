Abstract#==#In task-oriented dialog, agents need to generate both fluent natural language
responses and correct external actions like database queries and updates. Our
paper makes the first attempt at evaluating state of the art models on a large
real world task with human users. We show that methods that achieve state of
the art performance on synthetic datasets, perform poorly in real world dialog
tasks.
We propose a hybrid model, where nearest neighbor is used to generate fluent
responses and Seq2Seq type models ensure dialogue coherency and generate
accurate external actions. 
The hybrid model on the customer support data achieves a 78% relative
improvement in fluency, and a 200% improvement in accuracy of external calls.
