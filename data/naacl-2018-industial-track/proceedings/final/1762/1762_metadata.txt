Abstract#==#Industrial dialogue systems such as Apple Siri and Google Now rely on large
scale diverse and robust training data to enable their sophisticated
conversation capability. Crowdsourcing provides a scalable and inexpensive way
of data collection but collecting high quality data efficiently requires
thoughtful orchestration of the crowdsourcing jobs. Prior study of this topic
have focused on tasks only in the academia settings with limited scope or only
provide intrinsic dataset analysis, lacking indication on how it affects the
trained model performance. In this paper, we present a study of crowdsourcing
methods for a user intent classification task in our deployed dialogue system.
Our task requires classification of 47 possible user intents and contains many
intent pairs with subtle differences. We consider different crowdsourcing job
types and job prompts and analyze quantitatively the quality of the collected
data and the downstream model performance on a test set of real user queries
from production logs. Our observation provides insights into designing
efficient crowdsourcing jobs and provide recommendations for future dialogue
system data collection process.
