Abstract#==#Neural machine translation has achieved levels of fluency and adequacy that
would have been surprising a short time ago. Output quality is extremely
relevant for industry purposes, however it is equally important to produce
results in the shortest time possible, mainly for latency-sensitive
applications and to control cloud hosting costs. In this paper we show the
effectiveness of translating with 8-bit quantization for models that have been
trained using 32-bit floating point values. Results show that 8-bit translation
makes a non-negligible impact in terms of speed with no degradation in accuracy
and adequacy.
