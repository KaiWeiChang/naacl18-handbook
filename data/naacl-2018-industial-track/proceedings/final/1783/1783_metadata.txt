Abstract#==#We address the problem of determining entity-oriented polarity in business
  news.  This can be viewed as classifying the polarity of the sentiment
  expressed toward a given mention of a company in a news article.  We
  present a complete, end-to-end approach to the problem.  We introduce a
  new dataset of over 17,000 manually labeled documents, which is
  substantially larger than any currently available resources.  We propose a
  benchmark solution based on convolutional neural networks for
  classifying entity-oriented polarity.  Although our dataset is much larger
  than those currently available, it is small on the scale of datasets
  commonly used for training robust neural network models.  To compensate
  for this, we use transfer learning---pre-train the model on a much
  larger dataset, annotated for a related but different classification task,
  in order to learn a good representation for business text, and then
  fine-tune it on the smaller polarity dataset.
