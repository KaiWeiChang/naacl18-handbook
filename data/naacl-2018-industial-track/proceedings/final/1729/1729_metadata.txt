Abstract#==#At eBay, we are automatically generating
a large amount of natural language titles
for eCommerce browse pages using machine
translation (MT) technology. While automatic
approaches can generate millions of titles very
fast, they are prone to errors. We therefore develop
quality estimation (QE) methods which
can automatically detect titles with low quality
in order to prevent them from going live. In
this paper, we present different approaches:
The first one is a Random Forest (RF) model
that explores hand-crafted, robust features,
which are a mix of established features commonly
used in Machine Translation Quality
Estimation (MTQE) and new features developed
specifically for our task. The second
model is based on Siamese Networks (SNs)
which embed the metadata input sequence and
the generated title in the same space and do
not require hand-crafted features at all. We
thoroughly evaluate and compare those approaches
on in-house data. While the RF models
are competitive for scenarios with smaller
amounts of training data and somewhat more
robust, they are clearly outperformed by the
SN models when the amount of training data
is larger.
