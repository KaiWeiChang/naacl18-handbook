Abstract#==#As a specialized example of information extraction, part name extraction is an
area that presents unique challenges. Part names are typically multi-word terms
longer than two words. There is little consistency in how terms are described
in noisy free text, with variations spawned by typos, ad hoc abbreviations,
acronyms, and incomplete names. This makes search and analyses of parts in
these data extremely challenging. In this paper, we present our algorithm,
PANDA (Part Name Discovery Analytics), based on a unique method that exploits
statistical, linguistic and machine learning techniques to discover part names
in noisy text such as that in manufacturing quality documentation, supply chain
management records, service communication logs, and maintenance reports.
Experiments show that PANDA is scalable and outperforms existing techniques
significantly.
