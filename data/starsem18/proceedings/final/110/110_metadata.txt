Abstract#==#This paper presents a collection to assess meaning components in
  German complex verbs, which frequently undergo meaning shifts. We
  use a novel strategy to obtain source and target domain
  characterisations via sentence generation rather than sentence
  annotation. A selection of arrows adds spatial directional
  information to the generated contexts. We provide a broad
  qualitative description of the dataset, and a series of standard
  classification experiments verifies the quantitative reliability of
  the presented resource. The setup for collecting the meaning
  components is applicable also to other languages, regarding complex
  verbs as well as other language-specific targets that involve
  meaning shifts.
