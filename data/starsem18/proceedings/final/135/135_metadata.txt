Abstract#==#Fine-grained entity typing is the task of assigning fine-grained semantic types to  entity mentions. We propose a neural architecture which learns a distributional semantic representation that leverages a greater amount of semantic context -- both document and sentence level information -- than prior work.  We find that additional context improves performance, with further improvements gained by utilizing adaptive classification thresholds. Experiments show that our approach without reliance on hand-crafted features achieves the state-of-the-art results on three benchmark datasets.
