Abstract#==#The paper addresses detection of figurative usage
of words in English text. The chosen
method was to use neural nets fed by pretrained
word embeddings. The obtained results
show that simple solutions, based on
words embeddings only, are comparable to
complex solutions, using many sources of information
which are not available for languages
less-studied than English.
