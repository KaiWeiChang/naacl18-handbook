Abstract#==#Image caption generation has gathered widespread interest in the artificial
intelligence community. Automatic generation of an image description requires
both computer vision and natural language processing techniques.  While, there
has been advanced research in the English caption generation,  research on
generating Arabic descriptions of an image is extremely limited.  Semitic
languages like Arabic are heavily influenced by root-words.  We leverage this
critical dependency of Arabic to generate captions of an image directly in
Arabic using  root-word based Recurrent Neural Network and Deep Neural
Networks.  Experimental results on dataset from various Middle Eastern
newspaper websites allow us to report the first BLEU score for direct Arabic
caption generation.
We also compare the results of our approach with BLEU score captions generated
in English and translated in Arabic. Experimental results confirm that
generating image captions using root-words directly in Arabic significantly
outperforms the English-Arabic translated captions using state-of-the-art
methods.
