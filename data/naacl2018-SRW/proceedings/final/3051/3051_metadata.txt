Abstract#==#In this thesis proposal, we address the limitations of conventional pipeline design of task-oriented dialog systems and propose end-to-end learning solutions. We design neural network based dialog systems that are able to robustly track dialog state, interface with knowledge bases, and incorporate structured query results into system responses to successfully complete task-oriented dialog. In learning such neural network based dialog systems, we propose hybrid offline training and online interactive learning methods. We first train the dialog agent with task-oriented dialog corpora in a supervised manner. We then further improve the agent by letting it to interact with users and learn from user demonstration and feedback with imitation and reinforcement learning. In addressing the sample efficiency issue with online policy learning, we further propose a dialog learning method by combining the learning-from-user and learning-from-simulation approaches to improve the online interactive learning efficiency.
