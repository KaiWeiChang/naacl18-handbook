Abstract#==#Automatically extracting parallel sentence pairs from the multilingual articles available on the Internet can address the data sparsity problem in building multilingual natural language processing applications, especially in machine translation. In this project, we have used an end-to-end siamese bidirectional recurrent neural network to generate parallel sentences from comparable multilingual articles in Wikipedia.  Subsequently, we found that using the enriched dataset showed improved BLEU scores on both NMT and phrase-based SMT systems for English--Hindi and English--Tamil language pairs, when compared to training exclusively on curated bilingual corpora.
