Abstract#==#Sentence representations can capture a wide range of information that cannot be captured by local features based on character or word N-grams.
This paper examines the usefulness of universal sentence representations for eval- uating the quality of machine translation.
Al-though it is difficult to train sentence represen- tations using small-scale translation datasets with manual evaluation, sentence representa- tions trained from large-scale data in other tasks can improve the automatic evaluation of machine translation.
Experimental results of the WMT-2016 dataset show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance with sentence representation features only.
