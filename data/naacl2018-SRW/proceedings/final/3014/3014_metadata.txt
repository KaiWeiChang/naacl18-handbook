Abstract#==#In machine translation research, neural machine translation (NMT) has been
researched actively. However, NMT can generate only high-frequency words due to
the computational costs of softmax function in output layer.
On Japanese, predicate conjugation causes increasing vocabulary size. For
example, one verb has many varieties of surfaces up to 18. In this research, we
focus on predicate conjugation for compressing Japanese vocabulary
size.Therefore, the vocabulary list is filled with the various forms of verbs.
we propose methods using predicate conjugation information without discarding
linguistic information. Our methods make it possible to generate low-frequency
words and deal with unknown words. To introduce conjugation information, two
methods were considered: one method treating it as a token (Conjugation token)
and the other method treating it as an embedded vector (Conjugation feature).
The results using these methods show that the vocabulary size can be compressed
up to 86.1% (Tanaka corpus) and the NMT models can output the words not in the
training dataset. Furthermore, BLEU scores improved by 0.94 points on average
in Japanese to English translation, and 0.20 points on average in English to
Japanese translation.
