Abstract#==#We  introduce  an  automatic  system  that performs well on two common-sense rea-
soning tasks, the Winograd Schema Challenge (WSC) and the Choice of Plausible
Alternatives  (COPA).  Problem  instances from  these  tasks  require  diverse,   complex  forms  of  inference  and  knowledge to solve.  Our method uses a knowledge-hunting  module  to  gather  text  from  the web,  which  serves  as  evidence  for  candidate problem resolutions.  Given an input  problem,  our  system  generates  relevant  queries  to  send  to  a  search  engine. It extracts and classifies knowledge from the returned results and weighs it to make a  resolution.   Our  approach  improves  F1 performance on the WSC by 0.16 over the previous best and is competitive with the state-of-the-art  on  COPA,  demonstrating its general applicability.
