Abstract#==#Our system generates personalized hospital-stay summaries for patients by combining information from physician discharge notes and nursing plan of care. It uses a metric to identify medical concepts that are Complex, extracts definitions for the concept from three external knowledge sources, and provides the simplest definition to the patient. It also takes various features of the patient into account, like their concerns and strengths, ability to understand basic health information, level of engagement
in taking care of their health, familiarity with the health issue, and personalizes the content of summaries accordingly. Our evaluation showed that the summaries contain 80% of the medical concepts that are considered
as being important by both doctor and nurses. Three patient advisors (i.e individuals who are trained in understanding patient experience extensively) verified the usability of our summaries and mentioned that they would
like to get such summaries when they are discharged from hospital.
