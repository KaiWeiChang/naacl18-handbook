Abstract#==#We describe a novel method for identifying
hedge terms using a set of manually constructed
rules. We present experiments adding
hedge features to a committed belief system
to improve classification. We compare performance
of this system (a) without hedging features,
(b) with dictionary-based features, and
(c) with rule-based features. We find that using
hedge features improves performance of the
committed belief system, particularly in identifying
instances of non-committed belief and
reported belief.
