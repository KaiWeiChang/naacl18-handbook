Abstract#==#Multi-Sentence Compression (MSC) aims to generate a short sentence with key
information from a cluster of closely related sentences. MSC enables
summarization and question-answering systems to generate outputs combining
fully formed sentences from one or several documents. This paper describes a
new Integer Linear Programming method for MSC using a vertex-labeled graph to
select different keywords, and novel 3-gram scores to generate more informative
sentences while maintaining their grammaticality. Our system is of good quality
and outperforms the state-of-the-art for evaluations led on news dataset. We
led both automatic and manual evaluations to determine the informativeness and
the grammaticality of compressions for each dataset. Additional tests, which take advantage of the fact that the length of compressions can be modulated, still improve ROUGE scores with shorter output sentences.
