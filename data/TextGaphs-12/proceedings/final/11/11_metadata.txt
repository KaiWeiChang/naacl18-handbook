Abstract#==#Contrary to the traditional Bag-of-Words approach, we consider the Graph-of-Words(GoW) model in which each document is represented by a graph that encodes relationships between the different terms. 
Based on this formulation, the importance of a term is determined by weighting the corresponding node in the document, collection and label graphs, using node centrality criteria. 
We also introduce novel graph-based weighting schemes by enriching graphs with word-embedding similarities, in order to reward or penalize semantic relationships. 
Our methods produce more discriminative feature weights for text categorization, outperforming existing frequency-based criteria.
