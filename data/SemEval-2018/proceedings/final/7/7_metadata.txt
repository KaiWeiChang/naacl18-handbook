Abstract#==#This paper describes the ALANIS system that participated in Task 3 of
SemEval-2018. We develop a system for detection of irony, as well as the
detection of three types of irony: verbal polar irony, other verbal irony, and
situational irony. The system uses a logistic regression model in subtask A and
a voted classifier system with manually developed features to identify ironic
tweets. This model improves on a naive bayes baseline by about 8 percent on
training set.
