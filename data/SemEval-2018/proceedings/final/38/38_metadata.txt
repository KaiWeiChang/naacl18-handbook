Abstract#==#We describe our system for SemEval-2018 Shared Task on Semantic Relation
Extraction and Classification in Scientific Papers where we focus on the
Classification task. Our simple piecewise convolution neural encoder performs
decently in an end to end manner. A simple inter-task data augmentation
significantly boosts the performance of the model. Our best-performing systems
stood 8th out of 20 teams on the classification task on noisy data and 12th out
of 28 teams on the classification task on clean data.
