Abstract#==#This paper describes the NeuroSent system that participated in SemEval 2018
Task 3. 
Our system takes a supervised approach that builds on neural networks and word
embeddings. 
Word embeddings were built by starting from a repository of user generated
reviews.
Thus, they are specific for sentiment analysis tasks.
Then, tweets are converted in the corresponding vector representation and given
as input to the neural network with the aim of learning the different semantics
contained in each emotion taken into account by the SemEval task.
The output layer has been adapted based on the characteristics of each subtask.
Preliminary results obtained on the provided training set are encouraging for
pursuing the investigation into this direction.
