Abstract#==#We propose a novel attentive hybrid GRU-based network (SAHGN), which we used at
SemEval-2018 Task 1: Affect in Tweets. Our network has two main
characteristics, 1) has the ability to internally optimize its feature
representation using attention mechanisms, and 2) provides a hybrid
representation using a character level Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), as
well as a self-attentive word-level encoder. The key advantage of our model is
its ability to signify the relevant and important information that enables
self-optimization. Results are reported on the valence intensity regression
task.
