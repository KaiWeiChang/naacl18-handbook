Abstract#==#We present our methods and results for affect analysis in Twitter developed as a part of SemEval-2018 Task 1, where the sub-tasks involve predicting the intensity of emotion, the intensity of sentiment, and valence for tweets. For modeling, though we use a traditional LSTM network, we combine our model with several state-of-the-art techniques to improve its performance in a low-resource setting. For example, we use an encoder-decoder network to initialize the LSTM weights. Without any task specific optimization we achieve competitive results (macro-average Pearson correlation coefficient 0.696) in the El-reg task. In this paper, we describe our development strategy in detail along with an exposition of our results.
