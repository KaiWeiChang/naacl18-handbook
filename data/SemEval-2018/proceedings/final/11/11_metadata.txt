Abstract#==#This paper describes our system used in the English Emoji Prediction Task 2 at
the SemEval-2018. Our system is based on two supervised machine learning
algorithms: Gradient Boosting Regression Tree Method (GBM) and Bidirectional
Long Short-term Memory Network (BLSTM). Besides the common features, we extract
various lexicon and syntactic features from external resources. After comparing
the results of two algorithms, GBM is chosen for the final evaluation.
