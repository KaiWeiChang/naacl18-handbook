Abstract#==#Automatic extraction of semantic relations from text can support finding relevant information from scientific publications. We describe our participation in Task 7 of SemEval-2018 for which we experimented with two relations extraction tools - jSRE and TEES - for the extraction and classification of six relation types.
The results we obtained with TEES were significantly superior than those with jSRE (33.4% vs. 30.09% and 20.3% vs. 16%). Additionally, we utilized the model trained with TEES for extracting semantic relations from biomedical abstracts, for which we present a preliminary evaluation.
