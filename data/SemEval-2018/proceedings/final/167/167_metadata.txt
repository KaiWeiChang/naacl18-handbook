Abstract#==#In this paper, we describe our proposal for 
the task of Semantic Extraction from
Cybersecurity Reports. The goal 
is to explore if natural language processing methods 
can provide relevant and actionable
knowledge to contribute to better understand
malicious behavior. Our method consists of an 
attention-based Bi-LSTM which achieved competitive 
performance of 0.57 for the Subtask 1. In the 
due process we also present ablation studies 
across multiple embeddings and their level of representation
and also report the strategies we used to mitigate the extreme
imbalance between classes.
