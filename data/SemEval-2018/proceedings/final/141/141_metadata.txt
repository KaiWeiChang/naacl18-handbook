Abstract#==#This paper describes our system for the
SemEval-2018 Task 12: Argument Reasoning
Comprehension Task. We utilize skip-thought
vectors, sentence-level distributional vectors
inspired by the popular word embeddings and
the skip-gram model. We encode preprocessed
sentences from the dataset into vectors, then
perform a binary supervised classification of
the warrant that justifies the use of the reason
as support for the claim. We explore a few variations
of the model, reaching 54.1% accuracy
on the test set, which placed us 16th out of 22
teams participating in the task.
