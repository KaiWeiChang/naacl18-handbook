Abstract#==#This paper describes the systems submitted to SemEval 2018 Task 3 "Irony
detection in English tweets" for both subtasks A and B. The first system
leveraging a combination of sentiment, distributional semantic,  and text
surface features is ranked third among 44 teams according to the official
leaderboard of the subtask A. The second system with slightly different
representation of the features ranked ninth in subtask B. We present a method
that entails decomposing tweets into separate parts. Searching for contrast
within the constituents of a tweet is an integral part of our system. We
embrace an extensive definition of contrast which leads to a vast coverage in
detecting ironic content.
