Abstract#==#This paper describes our system created for the SemEval-2018 Task 3:  Irony
detection in English tweets.

Our strongly constrained system uses only the provided training data without
any additional external resources.
Our system is based on Maximum Entropy classifier and various features using
parse tree, POS tags, and morphological features.
Even without additional lexicons and word embeddings we achieved fourth place
in Subtask A and seventh in Subtask B in terms of accuracy.
