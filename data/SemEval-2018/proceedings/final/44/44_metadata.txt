Abstract#==#Character identification is an entity-linking task that finds words referring
to the same person among the nouns mentioned in a conversation and turns them
into one entity. In this paper, we define a sequence-labeling problem to solve
character identification, and propose an attention-based recurrent neural
network (RNN) encoder–decoder model. The in-put document for character
identification on multiparty dialogues consists of several conversations, which
increase the length of the input sequence. The RNN encoder–decoder model
suffers from poor performance when the length of the input sequence is long. To
solve this problem, we propose applying position encoding and the self-matching
network to the RNN encoder–decoder model. Our experimental results
demonstrate that of the four models proposed, Model 2 showed an F1 score of
86.00% and a label accuracy of 85.10% at the scene-level.
