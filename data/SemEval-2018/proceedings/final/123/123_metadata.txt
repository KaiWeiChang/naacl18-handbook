Abstract#==#This shared task is a typical question answering task. Compared with the normal question and answer system, it needs to give the answer to the question based on the text provided. The essence of the problem is actually reading comprehension. Typically, there are several questions for each text that correspond to it. And for each question, there are two candidate answers (and only one of them is correct). To solve this problem, the usual approach is to use convolutional neural networks (CNN) and recurrent neural network (RNN) or their improved models (such as long short-term memory (LSTM)). In this paper, an attention-based CNN-LSTM model is proposed for this task. By adding an attention mechanism and combining the two models, this experimental result has been significantly improved.
