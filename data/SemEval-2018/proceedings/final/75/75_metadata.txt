Abstract#==#Traditional sentiment analysis approaches mainly focus on classifying the
sentiment polarities or emotion categories of texts. However, they can't
exploit the sentiment intensity information. Therefore, the SemEval-2018 Task 1 is aimed to automatically determine the intensity of emotions or sentiment of tweets to mine fine-grained sentiment information. In order to address this
task, we propose a system based on an attention CNN-LSTM model. In our model,
LSTM is used to extract the long-term contextual information from texts. We
apply attention techniques to selecting this information. A CNN layer with
different size of kernels is used to extract local features. The dense layers
take the pooled CNN feature maps and predict the intensity scores. Our system
reaches average Pearson correlation score of 0.722 (ranked 12/48) in emotion
intensity regression task, and 0.810 in valence regression task (ranked 15/38). It indicates that our system can be further extended.
