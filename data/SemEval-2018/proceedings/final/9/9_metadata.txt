Abstract#==#This paper discusses SemEval-2018 Task 5: a referential quantification task of
counting events and participants in local, long-tail news documents with high
ambiguity. The complexity of this task challenges systems to establish the
meaning, reference and identity across documents. The task consists of three
subtasks and spans across three domains. We detail the design of this
referential quantification task, describe the participating systems, and
present additional analysis to gain deeper insight into their performance.
