Abstract#==#We present a novel neural architecture for the Argument Reasoning Comprehension task of SemEval 2018. 
It is a simple neural network consisting of three parts, collectively judging
whether the logic built on a set of given sentences (a claim, reason, and warrant) is plausible or not. 
The model utilizes contextualized word vectors pre-trained on large machine translation (MT) datasets as a form of transfer learning, which can help to mitigate the lack of training data. 
Quantitative analysis shows that simply leveraging LSTMs trained on MT datasets outperforms several baselines and non-transferred models, achieving accuracies
of about 70% on the development set and about 60% on the test set.
