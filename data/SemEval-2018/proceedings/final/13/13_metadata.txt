Abstract#==#This paper describes our participation in the SemEval-2018 task Multilingual
Emoji Prediction. We participated in both English and Spanish subtasks,
experimenting with support vector machines (SVMs) and recurrent neural
networks.  Our SVM classifier obtained the top rank in both subtasks with
macro-averaged F1-measures of 35.99% for English and 22.36% for Spanish data
sets.  Similar to a few earlier attempts, the results with neural networks were
not on par with linear SVMs.
