Abstract#==#We present our UWB system for the task of capturing discriminative attributes
at SemEval 2018. Given two words and an attribute, the system decides, whether
this attribute is discriminative between the words or not. Assuming
Distributional Hypothesis, i.e., a word meaning is related to the distribution
across contexts, we introduce several approaches to compare word contextual
information.

We experiment with state-of-the-art semantic spaces and with simple
co-occurrence statistics. We show the word distribution in the corpus has
potential for detecting discriminative attributes. Our system achieves F1 score
72.1% and is ranked #4 among 26 submitted systems.
