Abstract#==#We take a multi-task learning approach to the shared Task 1 at SemEval-2018.
The general idea concerning the model structure is to use as little external data as possible in order to preserve the task relatedness and reduce complexity.
We employ multi-task learning with hard parameter sharing to exploit the relatedness between sub-tasks. 
As a base model, we use a standard recurrent neural network for both the classification and regression subtasks.
Our system ranks 32nd out of 48 participants with a Pearson score of 0.557 in the first subtask, and 20th out of 35 in the fifth subtask with an accuracy score of 0.464.
