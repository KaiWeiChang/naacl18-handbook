Abstract#==#This article describes our proposed Arabic Sentiment Analysis system named ARB-SEN. This system is designed for the International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation 2018 (SemEval-2018), Task1:  Affect in Tweets.  ARB-SEN proposes two supervised models to estimate the sentiment intensity in Arabic tweets. Both models use a set of features including sentiment lexicon, negation, word embedding and emotion symbols features.   Our system combines these features to assist the sentiment analysis task. ARB-SEN system achieves a correlation score of 0.720, ranking 6th among all participants in the valence intensity regression (V-reg) for the Arabic sub-task organized within the SemEval 2018 evaluation campaign.
