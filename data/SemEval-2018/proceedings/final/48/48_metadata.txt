Abstract#==#Existing semantic models are capable of identifying the semantic similarity of
words. However, it's hard for these models to discriminate between a word and
another similar word. Thus, the aim of SemEval-2018 Task 10 is to predict
whether a word is a discriminative attribute between two concepts. In this
task, we apply a multilayer perceptron (MLP)-convolutional neural network (CNN) model to identify whether an attribute is discriminative. The CNNs are used to extract low-level features from the inputs. The MLP takes both the flatten CNN maps and inputs to predict the labels. The evaluation F-score of our system on the test set is 0.629 (ranked 15th), which indicates that our system still needs to be improved. However, the behaviours of our system in our experiments provide useful information, which can help to improve the collective understanding of this novel task.
