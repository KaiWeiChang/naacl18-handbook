Abstract#==#In this paper, we describe a machine reading
comprehension system that participated in
SemEval-2018 Task 11: Machine Comprehension
using commonsense knowledge. In
this work, we train a series of neural network
models such as multi-LSTM, BiLSTM, multi-
BiLSTM-CNN and attention-based BiLSTM,
etc. On top of some sub models, there are two
kinds of word embedding: (a) general word
embedding generated from unsupervised neural
language model; and (b) position embedding
generated from general word embedding.
Finally, we make a hard vote on the predictions
of these models and achieve relatively good
result. The proposed approach achieves 8th
place in Task 11 with the accuracy of 0.7213.
