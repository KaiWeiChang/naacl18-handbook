Abstract#==#This paper describes the approach that was developed for SemEval
2018 Task 2 (Multilingual Emoji Prediction) by the DUTH Team. 
First, we employed a combination of pre-processing techniques to reduce the noise of tweets and produce a number of features.
Then, we built several N-grams, to represent the combination of word and emojis. Finally, we trained our system with a tuned LinearSVC classifier.
Our approach in the leaderboard ranked 18th amongst 48 teams.
