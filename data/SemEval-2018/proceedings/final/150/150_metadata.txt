Abstract#==#In this paper we describe our system for
SemEval-2018 Task 7 on classification of semantic relations in scientific literature for
clean (subtask 1.1) and noisy data (subtask
1.2). We compare two models for classification, a C-LSTM which utilizes only word embeddings and an SVM that also takes handcrafted features into account. To adapt to the
domain of science we train word embeddings
on scientific papers collected from arXiv.org.
The hand-crafted features consist of lexical
features to model the semantic relations as
well as the entities between which the relation holds. Classification of Relations using
Embeddings (ClaiRE) achieved an F1 score of
74.89% for the first subtask and 78.39% for
the second.
