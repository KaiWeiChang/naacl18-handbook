Abstract#==#Discovering semantic relations within textual documents is a timely topic worthy of investigation.
Natural language processing strategies are generally used for linking chunks of text in order to extract information that can be exploited by semantic search engines for performing complex queries.
The scientific domain is an interesting area where these techniques can be applied.
In this paper, we describe a system based on neural networks applied to the SemEval 2018 Task 7.
The system relies on the use of word embeddings for composing the vectorial representation of text chunks.
Such representations are used for feeding a neural network aims to learn the structure of paths connecting chunks associated with a specific relation.
Preliminary results demonstrated the suitability of the proposed approach encouraging the investigation of this research direction.
