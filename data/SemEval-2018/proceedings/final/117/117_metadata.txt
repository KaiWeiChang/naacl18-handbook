Abstract#==#The Argument Reasoning Comprehension Task is a difficult challenge
  requiring significant language understanding and complex reasoning over world knowledge.
  We focus on transfer of a sentence encoder to bootstrap more complicated architectures
    given the small size of the dataset.
  Our best model uses a pre-trained BiLSTM to encode input sentences, 
    learns task-specific features for the argument and warrants,
    then performs independent argument-warrant matching.
  This model achieves mean test set accuracy of 61.31\%.
  Encoder transfer yields a significant gain to our best model over random initialization.
  Sharing parameters for independent warrant evaluation provides regularization 
  and effectively doubles the size of the dataset.
  We demonstrate that regularization comes from ignoring statistical correlations between warrant positions.
  We also report an experiment with our best model that only matches warrants to reasons, ignoring claims.
  Performance is still competitive, suggesting that our model is not necessarily learning the intended task.
