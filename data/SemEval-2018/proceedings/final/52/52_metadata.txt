Abstract#==#This paper reports our participation for SemEval-2018 Task 7 on extraction and
classification of relationships between entities in scientific papers. Our
approach is based on the use of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on350 abstract with manually annotated entities and relations. Our hypothesis is that this deep learning model can be applied to extract and classify relations between entities for scientific papers at the same time. We use the
Part-of-Speech and the distances to the target entities as part of the embedding for each word and we blind all the entities by marker names. In addition, we use sampling techniques to overcome the imbalance issues of this dataset. Our architecture obtained an F1-score of 35.4% for the relation extraction task and 18.5% for the relation classification task with a basic
configuration of the one step CNN.
