Abstract#==#This paper describes HCCL team systems that participated in SemEval 2018 Task 8: SecureNLP (Semantic Extraction from cybersecurity reports using NLP). To solve the problem, our team applied a neural network architecture that benefits from both word and character level representaions automatically, by using combination of Bi-directional LSTM, CNN and CRF (Ma and Hovy, 2016). Our system is truly end-to-end, requiring no feature engineering or data preprocessing, and we ranked 4th in the subtask 1, 7th in the subtask2 and 3rd in the SubTask2-relaxed.
