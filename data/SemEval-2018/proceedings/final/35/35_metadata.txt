Abstract#==#This article describes the unsupervised strategy submitted by the CitiusNLP
team to the SemEval 2018 Task 10, a task which consists of predict whether a
word is a discriminative attribute between two other words. Our strategy relies
on the correspondence between discriminative attributes and relevant contexts
of a word. More precisely, the method uses transparent distributional models to
extract salient contexts of words which are identified as discriminative
attributes. The system performance reaches about 70% accuracy when it is
applied on the development dataset, but its accuracy goes down (63%) on the
official test dataset.
