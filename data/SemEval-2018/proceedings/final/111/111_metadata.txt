Abstract#==#We present KOI (Knowledge of Incidents), a system that given news articles as input, builds a knowledge graph (KOI-KG) of incidental events.
KOI-KG can then be used to efficiently answer questions such "How many killing incidents happened in 2017 that involve Sean?" The required steps in building the KG include:
(i) document preprocessing involving word sense disambiguation, named-entity recognition, temporal expression recognition and normalization, and semantic role labeling;
(ii) incidental event extraction and coreference resolution via document clustering; and 
(iii) KG construction and population.
