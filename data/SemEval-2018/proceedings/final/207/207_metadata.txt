Abstract#==#This paper presents the outcomes of the Parsing Time Normalization shared task held within SemEval-2018. The aim of the task is to parse time expressions into the compositional semantic graphs of the Semantically Compositional Annotation of Time Expressions (SCATE) schema, which allows the representation of a wider vari- ety of time expressions than previous ap- proaches. Two tracks were included, one to evaluate the parsing of individual com- ponents of the produced graphs, in a clas- sic information extraction way, and an- other one to evaluate the quality of the time intervals resulting from the interpre- tation of those graphs. Though 40 par- ticipants registered for the task, only one team submitted output, achieving 0.55 F1 in Track 1 (parsing) and 0.70 F1 in Track 2 (intervals).
