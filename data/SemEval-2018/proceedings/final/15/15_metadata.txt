Abstract#==#This paper describes the system used and results obtained for team FOI DSS at
SemEval-2018 Task 1: Affect In Tweets. The team participated in all English
language subtasks, with a method utilizing transfer learning from
LSTM nets trained on large sentiment datasets combined with embeddings and
lexical features. For four out of five subtasks, the system performed in the
range of 92-95% of the winning systems, in terms of the competition metrics.
Analysis of the results suggests that improved pre-processing and addition of
more lexical features may further elevate performance.
