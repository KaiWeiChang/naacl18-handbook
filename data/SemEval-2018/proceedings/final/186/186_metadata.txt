Abstract#==#The paper presents NTNU's contribution to SemEval-2018 Task 7 on relation identification and classification. The class weights and parameters of five alternative supervised classifiers were optimized through grid search and cross-validation. The outputs of the classifiers were combined through voting for the final prediction. A wide variety of features were explored, with the most informative identified by feature selection. The best setting achieved F1 scores of 47.4% and 66.0% in the relation classification subtasks 1.1 and 1.2. For relation identification and classification in subtask 2, it achieved F1 scores of 33.9% and 17.0%,
