Abstract#==#This paper describes our approach, called
EPUTION, for the open trial of the SemEval-
2018 Task 2, Multilingual Emoji Prediction.
The task relates to using social media — more
precisely, Twitter — with its aim to predict
the most likely associated emoji of a tweet.
Our solution for this text classification prob-
lem explores the idea of transfer learning for
adapting the classifier based on users’ tweet-
ing history. Our experiments show that our
user-adaption method improves classification
results by more than 6 per cent on the macro-
averaged F1. Thus, our paper provides evi-
dence for the rationality of enriching the orig-
inal corpus longitudinally with user behaviors
and transferring the lessons learned from cor-
responding users to specific instances.
