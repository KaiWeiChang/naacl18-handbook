Abstract#==#This paper discusses the experiments performed
for predicting the emotion intensity in
tweets using a generalized supervised learning
approach. We extract 3 kind of features from
each of the tweets - one denoting the sentiment
and emotion metrics obtained from different
sentiment lexicons, one denoting the semantic
representation of the word using dense
representations like Glove, Word2vec and finally the syntactic information through POS
N-grams, Word clusters, etc. We provide
a comparative analysis of the significance of
each of these features individually and in combination
tested over standard regressors avaliable
in scikit-learn. We apply an ensemble of
these models to choose the best combination
over cross validation.
