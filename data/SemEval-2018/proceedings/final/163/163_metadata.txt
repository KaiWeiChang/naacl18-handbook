Abstract#==#Emotions are a way of expressing human sentiments. In the modern era, social media is a platform where we convey our emotions.
These emotions can be joy, anger, sadness
and fear. Understanding the emotions from
the written sentences is an interesting part in
knowing about the writer. In the amount of
digital language shared through social media,
a considerable amount of data reflects the sentiment or emotion towards some product, person and organization. Since these texts are
from users with diverse social aspects, these
texts can be used to enrich the application related to the business intelligence. More than the sentiment, identification of intensity of the
sentiment will enrich the performance of the
end application. In this paper we experimented
the intensity prediction as a text classification
problem that evaluates the distributed representation text using aggregated sum and dimensionality reduction of the glove vectors
of the words present in the respective texts .
