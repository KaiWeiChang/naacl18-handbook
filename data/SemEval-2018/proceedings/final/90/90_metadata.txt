Abstract#==#In this work we present our participation to SemEval-2018 Task 8 subtasks 1 & 2 respectively. We developed Convolution Neural Network system for malware sentence classification (subtask 1) and Conditional Random Fields system for malware token label prediction (subtask 2). We experimented with
couple of word embedding strategies, feature sets and achieved competitive performance across the two subtasks.

For subtask 1 We experimented with two category of word embeddings namely native embeddings and task specific embedding using Word2vec and Glove algorithms.

1. Native Embeddings: All words including the unknown ones that are randomly
initialized use embeddings from original Word2vec/Glove models.
2. Task specific : The embeddings are generated by training Word2vec/Glove algorithms on sentences from MalwareTextDB

We found that glove outperforms rest of embeddings for subtask 1.

For subtask 2, we used N-grams of size 6, previous, next tokens and labels, features giving disjunctions of words anywhere in the left or right, word shape features, word lemma of current, previous and next words, word-tag pair features, POS tags, prefix and suffixes.
