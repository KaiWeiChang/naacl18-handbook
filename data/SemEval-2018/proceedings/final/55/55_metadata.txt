Abstract#==#The paper describes our approach for SemEval-2018 Task 1: Affect
Detection in Tweets.
We perform experiments with manually compelled sentiment lexicons and word embeddings. We test their performance on twitter affect detection task to determine which features produce the most informative representation of a sentence. We demonstrate that general-purpose word embeddings produces more informative sentence representation than lexicon features. However, combining lexicon features with embeddings yields higher performance than embeddings alone.
