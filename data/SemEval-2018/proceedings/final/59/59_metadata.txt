Abstract#==#This paper describes the system submitted to SemEval 2018 shared task 10
‘Capturing Dicriminative  Attributes’.   We  use  a  combination  of 
knowledge-based  and  co-occurrence features to capture the semantic difference
between two words in relation to an attribute. We define scores based on
association measures, ngram counts,  word similarity,  and ConceptNet
relations.  The system is ranked 4th (joint) on the official leaderboard of the
task.
