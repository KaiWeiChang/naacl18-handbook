Abstract#==#In this paper we describe our submission to
SemEval-2018 Task 1: Affects in Tweets. The
model which we present is an ensemble of various
neural architectures and gradient boosted
trees, and employs three different types of vectorial
tweet representations. Furthermore, our
system is language-independent and ranked
first in 5 out of the 12 subtasks in which we
participated, while achieving competitive results
in the remaining ones. Comparatively remarkable
performance is observed on both the
Arabic and Spanish languages.
