Abstract#==#This paper describes our system, entitled
IronyMagnet, for the 3rd Task of the SemEval
2018 workshop, “Irony Detection in English
Tweets”. In Task 1, irony classification task
has been considered as a binary classification
task. Now for the first time, finer categories of
irony are considered as part of a shared task.
In task 2, three types of irony are considered;
“Irony by contrast” - ironic instances where
evaluative expression portrays inverse polar-
ity (positive, negative) of the literal propo-
sition; “Situational irony” - ironic instances
where output of a situation do not comply
with its expectation; “Other verbal irony” - in-
stances where ironic intent does not rely on
polarity contrast or unexpected outcome. We
proposed a Siamese neural network for irony
detection, which is consisted of two subnet-
works, each containing a long short term mem-
ory layer(LSTM) and an embedding layer ini-
tialized with vectors from Glove word embed-
ding 1 . The system achieved a f-score of 0.72,
and 0.50 in task 1, and task 2 respectively.
