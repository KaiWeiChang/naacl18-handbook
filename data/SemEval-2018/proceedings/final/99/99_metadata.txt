Abstract#==#This paper presents our single model to Sub- task 1 of SemEval 2018 Task 2: Emoji Prediction in English. In order to predict the emoji that may be contained in a tweet, the basic model we use is an attention-based recurrent neural network which has achieved satisfactory performs in Natural Language processing. Considering the text comes from social media, it contains many discrepant abbreviations and online terms, we also combine word-level and character-level word vector embedding to better handling the words not appear in the vocabulary. Our single model1 achieved 29.50% Macro F-score in test data and ranks 9th among 48 teams.
