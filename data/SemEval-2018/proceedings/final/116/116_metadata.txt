Abstract#==#While sentiment and emotion analysis has received a considerable amount of research attention, the notion of understanding and detecting the intensity of emotions is relatively less explored. This paper describes a system developed for predicting emotion intensity in tweets. Given a Twitter message, CrystalFeel uses features derived from parts-of-speech, n-grams, word embedding, and multiple affective lexicons including Opinion Lexicon, SentiStrength, AFFIN, NRC Emotion & Hash Emotion, and our in-house developed EI Lexicons to predict the degree of the intensity associated with fear, anger, sadness, and joy in the tweet. We found that including the affective lexicons-based features allowed the system to obtain strong prediction performance, while revealing interesting emotion word-level and message-level associations. On gold test data, CrystalFeel obtained Pearson correlations of 0.717 on average emotion intensity and of 0.816 on sentiment intensity.
