Abstract#==#This paper describes the system we submitted to SemEval-2018 Task 3. The aim of the system is to distinguish between irony and non-irony in English tweets. We create a targeted feature set and analyse how different features are useful in the task of irony detection, achieving an F1-score of 0.5914. The analysis of individual features provides insight that may be useful in future attempts at detecting irony in tweets.
