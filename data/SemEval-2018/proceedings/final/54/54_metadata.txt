Abstract#==#Semantic difference detection attempts to capture
whether a word is a discriminative attribute
between two other words. For example,
the discriminative feature red characterizes
the first word from the (apple, banana)
pair, but not the second. Modeling
semantic difference is essential for language
understanding systems, as it provides useful
information for identifying particular aspects
of word senses. This paper describes
our system implementation (the ALB system
of the NLP@Unibuc team) for the 10th task
of the SemEval 2018 workshop, “Capturing
Discriminative Attributes”. We propose a
method for semantic difference detection that
uses an SVM classifier with features based
on co-occurrence counts and shallow semantic
parsing, achieving 0.63 F1 score in the competition.
