Abstract#==#This paper discusses on task 1, ”Affect in
Tweets” sharedtask, conducted in SemEval-
2018. This task comprises of various subtasks,
which required participants to analyse
over different emotions and sentiments based
on the provided tweet data and also measure
the intensity of these emotions for subsequent
subtasks. Our approach in these task was to
come up with a model on count based representation
and use machine learning techniques
for regression and classification related
tasks. In this work, we use a simple bag of
words technique for supervised text classification
model as to compare, that even with
some advance distributed representation models
we can still achieve significant accuracy.
Further, fine tuning on various parameters for
the bag of word, representation model we acquired
better scores over various other baseline
models (Vinayan et al.) participated in the
sharedtask.
