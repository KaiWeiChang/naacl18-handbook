Abstract#==#Emoji is one of the ”fastest growing language
” in pop-culture, especially in social media and
it is very unlikely for its usage to decrease.
These are generally used to bring an extra level
of meaning to the texts, posted on social media
platforms. Providing such an added info,
gives more insights to the plain text, arising to
hidden interpretation within the text. This paper
explains our analysis on Task 2, ” Multilingual
Emoji Prediction” sharedtask conducted
by Semeval-2018. In the task, a predicted
emoji based on a piece of Twitter text are labelled
under 20 different classes (most commonly
used emojis) where these classes are
learnt and further predicted are made for unseen
Twitter text. In this work, we have experimented
and analysed emojis predicted based
on Twitter text, as a classification problem
where the entailing emoji is considered as a label
for every individual text data. We have implemented
this using distributed representation
of text through fastText. Also, we have made
an effort to demonstrate how fastText framework
can be useful in case of emoji prediction.
This task is divide into two subtask, they
are based on dataset presented in two different
languages English and Spanish.
