Abstract#==#This paper describes our submission for
SemEval 2018
Task 7 shared task on semantic relation extraction and classification in
scientific papers. Our
model is based on the end-to-end relation extraction model of
\cite{miwa2016end}  with several enhancements such as
character-level encoding attention mechanism on selecting pretrained concept
candidate embeddings. Our official
submission ranked the second in relation classification task (Subtask 1.1 and
Subtask 2 Senerio 2),
and the first in the relation extraction task (Subtask 2 Scenario 1).
