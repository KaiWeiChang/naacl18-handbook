Abstract#==#This paper describes our system submission to the SemEval 2018 Task 10 on
Capturing Discriminative Attributes. Given two concepts and an attribute, the
task is to determine whether the attribute is semantically related to one
concept and not the other. In this work we assume that discriminative
attributes can be detected by discovering the association (or lack of
association) between a pair of words. The hypothesis we test in this
contribution is whether the semantic difference between two pairs of concepts
can be treated in terms of measuring the distance between words in a vector
space, or can simply be obtained as a by-product of word co-occurrence counts.
