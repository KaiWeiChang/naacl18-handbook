Abstract#==#We demonstrate an intelligent conversational agent system designed for
advancing human-machine collaborative tasks. The agent is able to interpret a
user's communicative intent from both their verbal utterances and non-verbal
behaviors, such as gestures. The agent is also itself able to communicate both
with natural language and gestures, through its embodiment as an avatar thus
facilitating natural symmetric multi-modal interactions. We demonstrate two
intelligent agents with specialized skills in the Blocks World as use-cases of
our system.
