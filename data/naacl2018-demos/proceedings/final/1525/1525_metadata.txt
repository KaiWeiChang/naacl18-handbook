Abstract#==#This paper presents a web-based information system, RiskFinder, for
facilitating the analyses of soft and hard information in financial reports. 
In particular, the system broadens the analyses from the word level to sentence
level, which makes the system useful for practitioner communities and
unprecedented among financial academics.  The proposed system has four main
components: 1) a Form 10-K risk-sentiment dataset, consisting of a set of
risk-labeled financial sentences and pre-trained sentence embeddings; 2)
metadata, including basic information on each company that published the Form
10-K financial report as well as several relevant financial measures; 3) an
interface that highlights risk-related sentences in the financial reports based
on the latest sentence embedding techniques; 4) a visualization of financial
time-series data for a corresponding company.  This paper also conducts some
case studies to showcase that the system can be of great help in capturing
valuable insight within large amounts of textual information.  The system is
now online available at https://cfda.csie.org/RiskFinder/.
