Abstract#==#We present a system for resolving entities and disambiguating locations based on publicly avail- able web data in the domain of ancient Hindu Temples. Scarce, unstructured information poses a challenge to Entity Resolution(ER) and snippet ranking. Additionally, because the same set of entities may be associated with multiple locations, Location Disambiguation(LD) is a problem. The mentions and descriptions of temples 1 exist in the order of hundreds of thousands, with such data generated by various users in various forms such as text (Wikipedia pages), videos (YouTube videos), blogs, etc. We demonstrate an integrated approach using a combination of grammar rules for parsing and unsupervised (clustering) algo- rithms to resolve entity and locations with high confidence. A demo of our system is accessible at tinyurl.com/templedemos 2 . Our system is open source and available on GitHub 3 .
