Abstract#==#This paper presents NLP Lean Programming framework (NLPf), a new framework for
creating custom Natural Language Processing (NLP) models and pipelines by
utilizing common software development build systems. This approach allows
developers to train and integrate domain-specific NLP pipelines into their
applications seamlessly. Additionally, NLPf provides an annotation tool which
improves the annotation process significantly by providing a well-designed GUI
and sophisticated way of using input devices. Due to NLPf’s properties
developers and domain experts are able to build domain-specific NLP application
more effectively.
