Abstract#==#Madly Ambiguous is an open source, online game aimed at teaching audiences of
all ages about structural ambiguity and why it's hard for computers.  After a
brief introduction to structural ambiguity, users are challenged to complete a
sentence in a way that tricks the computer into guessing an incorrect
interpretation.  Behind the scenes are two different NLP-based methods for
classifying the user's input, one representative of classic rule-based
approaches to disambiguation and the other representative of recent neural
network approaches.  Qualitative feedback from the system's use in online,
classroom, and science museum settings indicates that it is engaging and
successful in conveying the intended take home messages.
