Abstract#==#We report on the creation of a dataset for
studying assessment of suicide risk via online
postings in Reddit. Evaluation of risk-level
annotations by experts yields what is, to our
knowledge, the first demonstration of reliability
in risk assessment by clinicians based on
social media postings. We also introduce and
demonstrate the value of a new, detailed rubric
for assessing suicide risk, compare crowdsourced
with expert performance, and present
baseline predictive modeling experiments using
the new dataset, which will be made available
to researchers through the American Association
of Suicidology.
