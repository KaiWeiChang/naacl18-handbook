Abstract#==#Social media analysis frequently requires tools
that can automatically infer demographics to
contextualize trends. These tools often require
hundreds of user-authored messages for each
user, which may be prohibitive to obtain when
analyzing millions of users. We explore
character-level neural models that learn a
representation of a userâ€™s name and screen
name to predict gender and ethnicity, allowing
for demographic inference with minimal
data. We release trained models1 which may
enable new demographic analyses that would
otherwise require enormous amounts of data
collection
