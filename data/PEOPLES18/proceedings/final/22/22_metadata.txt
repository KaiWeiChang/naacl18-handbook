Abstract#==#Twitter user accounts include a range
of different user types. While many
individuals use Twitter, organizations also
have Twitter accounts. Identifying opinions
and trends from Twitter requires the accurate
differentiation of these two groups. Previous
work (McCorriston et al., 2015) presented
a method for determining if an account
was an individual or organization based on
account profile and a collection of tweets.
We present a method that relies solely on the
account profile, allowing for the classification
of individuals versus organizations based
on a single tweet. Our method obtains
accuracies comparable to methods that rely
on much more information by leveraging
two improvements: a character-based
Convolutional Neural Network, and an
automatically derived labeled corpus an
order of magnitude larger than the previously
available dataset. We make both the dataset
and the resulting tool available.
