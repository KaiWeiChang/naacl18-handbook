Abstract#==#The computational treatment of emotion in
natural language text remains relatively limited,
and Arabic is no exception. This is partly
due to lack of labeled data. In this work, we
describe and manually validate a method for
the automatic acquisition of emotion labeled
data and introduce a newly developed data
set for Modern Standard and Dialectal Arabic
emotion detection focused at Robert Plutchikâ€™s
8 basic emotion types. Using a hybrid supervision
method that exploits first person emotion
seeds, we show how we can acquire promising
results with a deep gated recurrent neural
network. Our best model reaches 70% F-score,
significantly (i.e., 11%, p < 0:05) outperforming
a competitive baseline. Applying
our method and data on an external dataset of 4
emotions released around the same time we finalized
our work, we acquire 7% absolute gain
in F-score over a linear SVM classifier trained
on gold data, thus validating our approach.
