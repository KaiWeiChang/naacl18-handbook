Abstract#==#Written text transmits a good deal of nonverbal information related to the authorâ€™s identity
and social factors, such as age, gender and personality. However, it is less known to
what extent behavioral biometric traces transmit such information. We use typist data to
study the predictiveness of authorship, and present first experiments on predicting both
age and gender from keystroke dynamics. Our results show that the model based on keystroke
features, while being two orders of magnitude smaller, leads to significantly higher accuracies
for authorship than the text-based system. For user attribute prediction, the best approach
is to combine the two, suggesting that extralinguistic factors are disclosed to a larger degree
in written text, while author identity is better transmitted in typing behavior.
