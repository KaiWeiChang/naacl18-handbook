Abstract#==#We report the findings of the second Complex Word Identification (CWI) shared task
organized as part of the BEA workshop co-located with NAACL-HLT’2018. The second CWI shared task featured multilingual and multi-genre datasets divided into four tracks:
English monolingual, German monolingual, Spanish monolingual, and a multilingual track
with a French test set, and two tasks: binary classification and probabilistic classification. A total of 12 teams submitted their results in different task/track combinations and 11 of them wrote system description papers that are referred to in this report and appear in the BEA workshop proceedings.
