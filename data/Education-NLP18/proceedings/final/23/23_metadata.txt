Abstract#==#Developing plausible distractors (wrong answer options) when writing multiple-choice questions has been described as one of the
most challenging and time-consuming parts of the item-writing process. In this paper we propose a fully automatic method for generating distractor suggestions for multiple-choice questions used in high-stakes medical exams.
The system uses a question stem and the correct answer as an input and produces a list of suggested distractors ranked based on their similarity to the stem and the correct answer. To do this we use a novel approach of combining concept embeddings with information retrieval methods. We frame the evaluation as a prediction task where we aim to “predict” the human-produced distractors used in large sets of medical questions, i.e. if a distractor generated by our system is good enough it is likely
to feature among the list of distractors produced by the human item-writers. The results reveal that combining concept embeddings
with information retrieval approaches significantly improves the generation of plausible distractors and enables us to match around 1 in 5 of the human-produced distractors. 
The approach proposed in this paper is generalisable to all scenarios where the distractors refer to concepts.
