Abstract#==#This paper presents the participation of the LaSTUS/TALN team in the Complex Word Identification (CWI) Shared Task 2018 in the English monolingual track . The purpose of the task was to determine if a word in a given sentence can be judged as complex or not by a certain target audience. For the English track, task organizers provided a training and a development datasets of 27,299 and 3,328 words respectively together with the sentence in which each word occurs. The words were judged as complex or not by 20 human evaluators; ten of whom are natives.
We  submitted two systems: one system modeled each word to evaluate as a 
numeric vector populated with a set of lexical, semantic and contextual features while the other system relies on a word embedding representation
and a distance metric. We trained two separate classifiers to automatically 
decide if each word is complex or not. We submitted six runs,
two for each of the three subsets of the English monolingual CWI track.
