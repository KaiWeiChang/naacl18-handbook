Abstract#==#Many of the creative and figurative elements that make language
exciting are lost in translation in current natural language
generation engines. In this paper, we explore a method to harvest
templates from positive and negative reviews in the restaurant domain,
with the goal of vastly expanding the types of stylistic variation
available to natural language generators. We learn hyperbolic
adjective patterns that are representative of the strongly-valenced
expressive language commonly used in either positive or negative
reviews.  We then identify and delexicalize entities, and use
heuristics to extract generation templates from review sentences. We
evaluate the learned templates against more traditional review
templates, using subjective measures of convincingness, 
interestingness, and naturalness. Our results show that the
learned templates score highly on these measures.
We plan to use the learned templates to improve the
conversational style of dialogue systems in the
restaurant domain.
