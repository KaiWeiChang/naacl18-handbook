Abstract#==#This work investigates a zero-shot translation
(directions not observed at training time) in a
multilingual setting. We propose an iterative
training procedure that leverages a duality of
translations directly generated by the system
(i.e source→target and target→source), to be
used together with the original parallel data
to feed and iteratively re-train the multilingual
network. Over time, this allows the system to
learn from its own generated and increasingly
better output. Our approach shows to be effective
in improving the zero-shot directions
of the multilingual model. In particular, we
observed gains of about 9 BLEU points over
a baseline multilingual model and up to 2.08
BLEU over a pivoting mechanism using two
bilingual models.
