Abstract#==#The detection and classification of domestic abuse stories shared online has
ever-increasing importance in today's social activism sphere. With massive
numbers of stories shared, automatic detection of these stories can help push
forward the fight against domestic abuse from a social campaign to social
change. We develop CNN-RNN neural models to detect domestic abuse stories in
the Reddit Domestic Abuse dataset. We achieved 95.6% accuracy in classifying
posts as containing abuse stories vs. not containing abuse stories,
outperforming the current state-of-the-art. More importantly, we next present
interpretable and explainable analysis of the neural model predictions using
activation clustering techniques to automatically discover linguistic features.
