Abstract#==#In this paper we propose a model to learn joint representations for images and
sentences in different languages, with the aim of advancing multilingual
versions of image search and image understanding.
Our model learns a common representations for
images and their descriptions in two different languages (which need not be
parallel) by considering the image 
as a bridge between two languages. We evaluate our models on image-description
ranking for German and English.
