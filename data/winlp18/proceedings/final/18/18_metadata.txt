Abstract#==#We present work on a data set of real recordings
from psychotherapeutic sessions in German.
In order to semi-automatically judge the
therapy quality we use information about emotionality
in the therapist and the patient. Our
hypothesis is that patients and therapists show
their emotions differently and also show different
emotions. Before adding these features to
a machine-learning setup, we conduct a qualitative
study guided by language-specific phenomena,
which indicate aspects of attitude and
emotionality.
