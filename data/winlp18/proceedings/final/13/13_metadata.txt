Abstract#==#Named Entities Recognition (NER) is one of the most challenging tasks in
Natural Language Processing. This task was usually done by the state-of-the-art
techniques such as Support Vector Machine and Conditional Random Fields. This
paper investigated an application of neural network-based approach to recognize
named entities in low-resource language, with application on Vietnamese. We
constructed a bidirectional neural network-based model with the additional
information from a pre-trained word embedding model to better recognize new
named entities, which did not appear in the training data. The experiments
showed our proposed approach outperformed the state-of-the-art models with the
significant gains of F1 score.
