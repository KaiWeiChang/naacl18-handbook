Abstract#==#Learning vocabulary is essential to successful
communication. Complicating the task is
the underappreciated fact that most common
words are associated with multiple senses.
While a relatively low proportion of words
have senses that are unrelated to one another
(e.g., flying bat vs. baseball bat), very many
words evoke distinct but related senses (are
polysemous) (e.g., baseball cap vs. cap of a
bottle). Models of human word learning have
thus far failed to represent this level of naturalistic
complexity. We propose an an extension
to a feature-based computational model that
allows word senses to be represented distinctly
(by a set of structured features), while also allowing
overlap among senses to be captured
(by comparisons of sets of sets). The model
is shown to closely match human performance
on a novel word learning task, in which people
learn polysemous senses more easily than
ambiguous meanings.
