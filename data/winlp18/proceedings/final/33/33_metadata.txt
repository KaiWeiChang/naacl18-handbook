Abstract#==#This study investigated the possibility of developing a large vocabulary
continuous speech recognizer (LVCSR) for Amharic using the different syllable
types V, CV, VC, CVC, VCC and CVCC found in the language as acoustic units.
Syllables as longer length acoustic units are able to embed the spectral and
temporal dependencies found in speech and thus able to model it well. The
recognizer was developed using the Hidden Markov Model as a modeling technique.
The result of the experiments shows that syllables are promising units for
Amharic LVCSR provided that enough training data is available.
