Abstract#==#We present an LSTM-based multi-label sentence classifier as a tool to assist in the automation of systematic reviews for evidence-based medicine. Our model incorporates domain-specific word embeddings relevant to the biomedical information extraction task. We compare binary relevance and multi-label classifier settings on an expert-annotated corpus of abstracts, finding that learning labels jointly provides modest gains to performance.
