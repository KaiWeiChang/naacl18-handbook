Abstract#==#In this paper, we propose a new suggestion intent definition and a three--stage
road-map for fully understanding user suggestion intent from conversational
texts. We introduce a new unit of suggestion based on the ISO standard 24617-2:
Functional Segment. Our framework contains two phases: Functional Segment (FS)
segmentation, Filtering FSs that carries suggestion intents. We use Conditional
random field (CRF) method for segmentation phase and Maximum entropy (ME)
method for filtering phase. The results of these experiments on Vietnamese
online media texts are very promising. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first study to analyze suggestion at functional segment level and also the
first to propose a complete road-map for fully mining suggestion.
