Abstract#==#Our research proposes the use of culturally significant topics and pedagogy
that transforms students from technological consumers to producers while
leveraging both traditional educational methodologies along with access to
social media data in order to expose students to text based analysis and
informatics techniques toward a foundation in data science literacy for
cross-disciplinary applications.
