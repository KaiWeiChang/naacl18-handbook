Abstract#==#In this study an attempt is made to optimize the output of Amharic speech
recognizer using n-gram based post-edit algorithm without human intervention.
Experimental result shows that the integration of post-editing algorithm with
the recognizer improve the accuracy of recognition. Now we are working towards
connecting the optimized speech recognition to Amharic-English speech
translation.
