Abstract#==#Information extraction today faces new challenges with noisy, short,
unstructured data. These challenges are created in huge proportions on a daily
basis. This is especially the case for social media messages, such as tweets,
in which language can be erroneous or cryptic, and contains references to a
great number of new entities. Traditional NER systems are challenged and need
to develop new strategies to handle with these data. To this end, we
experimented the use of both unsupervised word clusters (w2v) and online
lexicon gathering  (\textit{mediawiki}), to provide lexical groundings to a
classical CRF system. This system has been tested on both French (CAp'2017) and
English (WNUT'2016) NER competition datasets. It obtained very good results
with a minimal training and development cost. The paper describes the method,
the system design, the evaluation campaign dataset and the obtained results.
