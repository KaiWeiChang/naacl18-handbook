Abstract#==#In polysynthetic languages, a word can consist of many individual morphemes, which causes a strong need for morphological segmentation. However, many polysynthetic languages are minimal-resource languages, making the training of state-of-the-art neural segmentation systems difficult. Here, we present a new dataset for morphological segmentation for 4 indigenous Mexican languages, and show that neural sequence-to-sequence models obtain competitive performance even for small amounts of training data. Additionally, we introduce two novel data augmentation and two novel multi-task approaches, which further increase performance.
