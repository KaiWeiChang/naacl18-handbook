Abstract#==#Speakers adapt their speaking style to match that of their interlocutor in a
process described as linguistic entrainment or accommodation. While previous
studies have considered the entrainment of acoustic-prosodic features in
spoken dialogue, the entrainment of phonation has not been examined. Using a
hand-annotated and automatically classified dataset of phonation labels, I
examine the entrainment of creaky voice in partners over several dimensions.
I additionally consider how speaker and partner gender affect both rates of
creak and entrainment in a cooperative dialogue.
