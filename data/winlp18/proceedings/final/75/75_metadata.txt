Abstract#==#In this paper, dialogue overlap at the transaction unit structure level is examined. In particular we investigate a corpus of multi-floor dialogue in a human-robot navigation domain. Two conditions are contrasted: a human wizard typing with a keyboard vs using a constricted GUI. The GUI condition leads to more utterances and transaction units, but leads to less overlap at the transaction unit level.
