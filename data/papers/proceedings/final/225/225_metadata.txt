Abstract#==#We investigate grounded sentence representations, where we train a sentence
encoder to predict the image features of a given caption---i.e., we try to
``imagine'' how a sentence would be depicted visually---and use the resultant
features as sentence representations. We examine the quality of the learned
representations on a variety of standard sentence representation quality
benchmarks, showing improved performance for grounded models over non-grounded
ones. In addition, we thoroughly analyze the extent to which grounding
contributes to improved performance, and show that the system also learns
improved word embeddings.
