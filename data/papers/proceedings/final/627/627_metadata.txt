Abstract#==#We often talk about events that impact us positively
 or negatively. For example “I got a job”
is good news, but “I lost my job” is bad news.
When we discuss an event, we not only understand 
its affective polarity but also the reason
why the event is beneficial or detrimental. For
example, getting or losing a job has affective
polarity primarily because it impacts us financially. 
Our work aims to categorize affective
events based upon human need categories that
often explain people’s motivations and desires:
PHYSIOLOGICAL, HEALTH, LEISURE, SOCIAL, 
FINANCIAL, COGNITION, and FREEDOM. 
We create classification models based
on event expressions as well as models that
use contexts surrounding event mentions. We
also design a co-training model that learns
from unlabeled data by simultaneously training 
event expression and event context classifiers 
in an iterative learning process. Our results 
show that co-training performs well, producing 
substantially better results than the individual classifiers.
