Abstract#==#This paper explores the time course of lexical memory retrieval by modeling
fluent language production. The duration of retrievals is predicted using the
ACT-R cognitive architecture. In a large-scale observational study of a spoken
corpus, we find that language production at a time point preceding a word is
sped up or slowed down depending on activation of that word. This computational
analysis has consequences for the theoretical model of language production. The
results point to interference between lexical and phonological stages as well
as a quantifiable buffer for lexical information that opens up the possibility
of non-sequential retrievals.
