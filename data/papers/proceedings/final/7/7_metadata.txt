Abstract#==#Summarizing a document requires identifying the important parts of the document
with an objective of providing a quick overview to a reader. However, a long
article can span several topics and a single summary cannot do justice to all
the topics. Further, the interests of readers can vary and the notion of
importance can change across them. Existing summarization algorithms generate a
single summary and are not capable of generating multiple summaries tuned to
the interests of the readers. In this paper, we propose an attention based RNN
framework to generate multiple summaries of a single document tuned to
different topics of interest. Our method outperforms existing baselines and our
results suggest that the attention of generative networks can be successfully
biased to look at sentences relevant to a topic and effectively used to
generate topic-tuned summaries.
