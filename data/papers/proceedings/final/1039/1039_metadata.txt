Abstract#==#This paper introduces rank-based training of structured prediction energy
networks (SPENs). Our method samples from output structures using gradient
descent and minimizes the ranking violation of the sampled structures with
respect to a scalar scoring function defined with domain knowledge. We have
successfully trained SPEN for citation field extraction without any labeled
data instances, where the only source of supervision is a simple human-written
scoring function.  Such scoring functions are often easy to provide; the SPEN
then furnishes an efficient structured prediction inference procedure.
