Abstract#==#This paper introduces a new dataset of term annotation.
Given that even experts vary significantly
in their understanding of termhood, and
that term identification is mostly performed
as a binary task, we offer a novel perspective
to explore the common, natural understanding
of what constitutes a term: Laypeople annotate
single-word and multi-word terms, across
four domains and across four task definitions.
Analyses based on inter-annotator agreement
offer insights into differences in term specificity,
term granularity and subtermhood.
