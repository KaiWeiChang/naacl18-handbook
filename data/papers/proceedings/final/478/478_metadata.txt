Abstract#==#Diachronic distributional models track changes in word use over time. In this
paper, we propose a deep neural network diachronic distributional model.
Instead of modeling lexical change via a time series as is done in previous
work, we represent time as a continuous variable and model a word's usage as a
function of time. Additionally, we have also created a novel synthetic task
which measures a model's ability to capture the semantic trajectory. This
evaluation quantitatively measures how well a model captures the
semantic trajectory of a word over time. Finally, we explore how well the
derivatives of our model can be used to measure the speed of lexical change.
