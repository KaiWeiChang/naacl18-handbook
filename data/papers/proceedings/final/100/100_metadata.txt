Abstract#==#Ontologies compartmentalize types and relations in a target domain and provide
the semantic backbone needed for a plethora of practical applications. Very
often different ontologies are developed independently for the same domain.
Such “parallel” ontologies raise the need for a process that will establish
alignments between their entities in order to unify and extend the existing
knowledge. In this work, we present a novel entity alignment method which we
dub DeepAlignment. DeepAlignment refines pre-trained word vectors aiming at
deriving ontological entity descriptions which are tailored to the ontology
matching task. The absence of explicit information relevant to the ontology
matching task during the refinement process makes DeepAlignment completely
unsupervised. We empirically evaluate our method using standard ontology
matching benchmarks. We present significant performance improvements over the
current state-of-the-art, demonstrating the advantages that representation
learning techniques bring to ontology matching.
