Abstract#==#Users participate in online discussion forums to learn from others and share their
knowledge with the community. They often start a thread with a question or sharing
their new findings on a certain topic. We
find that, unlike Community Question Answering, where questions are mostly factoid based, the threads in a forum are often
open-ended (e.g., asking for recommendations from others) without a single correct answer. In this paper, we address the
task of identifying helpful posts in a forum
thread, to aid users comprehend long running discussion threads, which often contain repetitive or even irrelevant posts. We
propose a recurrent neural network based
architecture to model (i) the relevance of a
post regarding the original post starting the
thread and (ii) the novelty it brings to the
discussion, compared to the previous posts
in the thread. Experimental results on five
different types of online forum datasets
show that our model significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art neural network
models for text classification.
