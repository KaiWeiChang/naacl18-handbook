Abstract#==#The intensive use of e-communications in everyday life has given rise to new
threats and risks. When the vulnerable asset is the user, detecting these
potential attacks before they cause serious damages is extremely important.
This paper proposes a novel document representation to improve the early
detection of risks in social media sources. The goal is to effectively identify
the potential risk using as few text as possible and with as much anticipation
as possible. Accordingly, we devise a Multi-Resolution Representation (MulR),
which allows us to generate multiple ``views" of the analyzed text. These views
capture different semantic meanings for words and documents at different levels
of detail, which is very useful in early scenarios to model the variable
amounts of evidence. Intuitively, the representation captures better the
content of short documents (very early stages) in low resolutions, whereas
large documents (medium/large stages) are better modeled with higher
resolutions. We evaluate the proposed ideas in two different tasks where
anticipation is critical: sexual predator detection and depression detection.
The experimental evaluation for these early tasks revealed that the proposed
approach outperforms previous methodologies by a considerable margin.
