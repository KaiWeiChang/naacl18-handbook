Abstract#==#Prepositions are among the most frequent words in English and play complex roles in the syntax and semantics of sentences. Not surprisingly, they pose well-known difficulties in automatic processing of sentences (prepositional attachment ambiguities and idiosyncratic uses in phrases). 
Existing methods on preposition representation  treat prepositions no different from content words (e.g., word2vec and GloVe). In addition, recent studies aiming at solving prepositional attachment and preposition selection problems
 depend heavily on external linguistic resources and use dataset-specific word representations. 
In this paper we use {\em word-triple} counts (one of the triples being a preposition) to  capture a preposition's interaction with its attachment and complement. We then derive preposition embeddings via tensor decomposition on a large unlabeled corpus.  
We reveal a new geometry involving Hadamard products and empirically demonstrate its utility in paraphrasing  phrasal verbs. Furthermore, our preposition  embeddings are used as simple features in two challenging downstream tasks: preposition selection and prepositional attachment disambiguation. We achieve results comparable to or better than the state-of-the-art on  multiple standardized datasets.
