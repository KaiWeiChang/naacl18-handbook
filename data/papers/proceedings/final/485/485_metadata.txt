Abstract#==#We introduce KBGAN, an adversarial learning framework to improve the
performances of a wide range of existing knowledge graph embedding models.
Because knowledge graphs typically only contain positive facts, sampling useful
negative training examples is a nontrivial task. Replacing the head or tail
entity of a fact with a uniformly randomly selected entity is a conventional
method for generating negative facts, but the majority of the generated
negative facts can be easily discriminated from positive facts, and will
contribute little towards the training. Inspired by generative adversarial
networks (GANs), we use one knowledge graph embedding model as a negative
sample generator to assist the training of our desired model, which acts as the
discriminator in GANs. This framework is independent of the concrete form of
generator and discriminator, and therefore can utilize a wide variety of
knowledge graph embedding models as its building blocks. In experiments, we
adversarially train two translation-based models, TRANSE and TRANSD, each with
assistance from one of the two probability-based models, DISTMULT and COMPLEX.
We evaluate the performances of KBGAN on the link prediction task, using three
knowledge base completion datasets: FB15k-237, WN18 and WN18RR. Experimental
results show that adversarial training substantially improves the performances
of target embedding models under various settings.
