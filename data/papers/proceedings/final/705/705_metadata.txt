Abstract#==#The task of natural question generation is to generate a corresponding question given the input passage (fact) and answer.
It is useful for enlarging the training set of QA systems.
Previous work has adopted sequence-to-sequence models that take a passage with an additional bit to indicate answer position as input.
However, they do not explicitly model the information between answer and other context within the passage.
We propose a model that matches the answer with the passage before generating the question. 
Experiments show that our model outperforms the existing state of the art using rich features.
