Abstract#==#We present data and methods that enable a supervised
learning approach to Open Information Extraction (Open IE).
Central to the approach is a novel formulation of Open IE as a sequence tagging
problem, addressing challenges such as encoding multiple extractions for a
predicate.
We also develop a bi-LSTM transducer, extending recent deep Semantic Role
Labeling models to extract Open IE tuples and provide confidence scores for
tuning their precision-recall tradeoff.
Furthermore, we show that the recently released Question-Answer Meaning
Representation dataset can be automatically converted into an Open IE corpus
which significantly increases the amount of available training data.
Our supervised model outperforms the existing state-of-the-art Open IE systems
on benchmark datasets.
