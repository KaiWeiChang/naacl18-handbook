Abstract#==#We propose the first generative models for three types of extra-grammatical
word formation phenomena abounding in slang: Blends, Clippings, and
Reduplicatives. Adopting a data-driven approach coupled with linguistic
knowledge, we propose simple models with state of the art performance on human
annotated gold standard datasets. Overall, our models reveal insights into the
generative processes of word formation in slang -- insights which are
increasingly relevant in the context of the rising prevalence of slang and
non-standard varieties on the Internet
