Abstract#==#Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) parsing aims at abstracting away from the
syntactic realization of a sentence, and denote only its meaning in a canonical
form. As such, it is ideal for paraphrase detection, a problem in which one is
required to specify whether two sentences have the same meaning. We show that
na\"{i}ve use of AMR in paraphrase detection
is not necessarily useful, and turn to describe a technique based on latent
semantic analysis in combination with AMR parsing that significantly advances
state-of-the-art results in paraphrase detection for the Microsoft Research
Paraphrase Corpus. Our best results in the transductive setting are 86.6\% for
accuracy and 90.0\% for F$_1$ measure.
