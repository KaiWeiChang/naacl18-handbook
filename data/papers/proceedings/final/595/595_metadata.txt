Abstract#==#Efficient word representations play an important role in solving various
problems related to Natural Language Processing (NLP), data mining, text mining
etc. The issue of data sparsity poses a great challenge in creating efficient
word representation model for solving the underlying problem. The problem is
more intensified in resource-poor scenario due to the absence of sufficient
amount of corpus. In this work we propose to minimize the effect of data
sparsity by leveraging bilingual word embeddings learned through a parallel
corpus. We train and evaluate Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) based architecture
for aspect level sentiment classification. 
The neural network architecture is further assisted by the hand-crafted
features for the prediction. We show the efficacy of the proposed model against
state-of-the-art methods in two experimental setups i.e. multi-lingual and
cross-lingual.
