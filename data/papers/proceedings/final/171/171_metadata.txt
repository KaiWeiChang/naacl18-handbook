Abstract#==#In this paper, we study the problem of parsing structured knowledge graphs from
textual descriptions. In particular, we consider the scene graph representation
that considers objects together with their attributes and relations: this
representation has been proved useful across a variety of vision and language
applications. We begin by introducing an alternative but equivalent
edge-centric view of scene graphs that connect to dependency parses. Together
with a careful redesign of label and action space, we combine the two-stage
pipeline used in prior work (generic dependency parsing followed by simple
post-processing) into one, enabling end-to-end training. The scene graphs
generated by our learned neural dependency parser achieve an F-score similarity
of 49.67% to ground truth graphs on our evaluation set, surpassing best
previous approaches by 5%. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of our
learned parser on image retrieval applications.
