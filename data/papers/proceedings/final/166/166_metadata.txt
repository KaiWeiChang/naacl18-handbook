Abstract#==#We present a method for improving word alignments using word similarities. This
method is based on encouraging common alignment links between semantically
similar words. We use word vectors trained on monolingual data to estimate 
similarity. Our experiments on translating fifteen languages into English show
consistent BLEU score improvements across the languages.
