Abstract#==#We propose a new model for speaker naming in movies that leverages visual,
textual, and acoustic modalities in an unified optimization framework. To
evaluate the performance of our model, we introduce a new dataset  consisting
of six episodes of the Big Bang Theory TV show and eighteen full movies
covering different genres. Our experiments show that our multimodal model
significantly outperforms several competitive baselines on the average weighted
F-score metric. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, we design an
end-to-end memory network model that leverages our speaker naming model and
achieves state-of-the-art results on the subtitles task of the MovieQA 2017
Challenge.
