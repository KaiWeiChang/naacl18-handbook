Abstract#==#We present a computational model to detect and distinguish analogies in meaning
shifts between German base and complex verbs. In contrast to corpus-based
studies, a novel dataset demonstrates that “regular” shifts represent the
smallest class. Classification experiments relying on a standard similarity
model successfully distinguish between four types of 
shifts, with verb classes boosting the performance, and affective features for
abstractness, emotion and sentiment representing the most salient indicators.
