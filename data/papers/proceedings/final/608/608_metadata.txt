Abstract#==#Recognizing that even correct translations are not always semantically
equivalent, we automatically detect meaning divergences in parallel sentence
pairs with a deep neural model of bilingual semantic similarity which can be
trained for any parallel corpus without any  manual annotation. We show that our semantic model
detects divergences more accurately than models based on surface features
derived from word alignments, and that these divergences matter for neural machine translation.
