Abstract#==#A core part of linguistic typology is the classification of languages according
to linguistic properties, such as those detailed in the World Atlas of Language
Structure (WALS).
Doing this manually is prohibitively time-consuming, which is in part evidenced
by the fact that only 100 out of over 7,000 languages spoken in the world are
fully covered in WALS.

We learn distributed language representations, which can be used to predict
typological properties on a massively multilingual scale. 
Additionally, quantitative and qualitative analyses of these language
embeddings can tell us how language similarities are encoded in NLP models for
tasks at different typological levels.
The representations are learned in an unsupervised manner alongside tasks at
three typological levels: phonology (grapheme-to-phoneme prediction, and
phoneme reconstruction), morphology (morphological inflection), and syntax
(part-of-speech tagging). 

We consider more than 800 languages and find significant differences in the
language representations encoded, depending on the target task.
For instance, although Norwegian Bokm√•l and Danish are typologically close to
one another, they are phonologically distant, which is reflected in their
language embeddings growing relatively distant in a phonological task.
We are also able to predict typological features in WALS with high accuracies,
even for unseen language families.
