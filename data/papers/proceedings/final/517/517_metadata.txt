Abstract#==#Task extraction is the process of identifying search intents over a set of
queries potentially spanning multiple search sessions. Most existing research
on task extraction has focused on identifying tasks within a single session,
where the notion of a session is defined by a fixed length time window. By
contrast, in this work we seek to identify tasks that span across multiple
sessions. To identify tasks, we conduct a global analysis of a query log in its
entirety without restricting analysis to individual temporal windows.
To
capture inherent task semantics, 
we represent queries as vectors in an abstract space. 
We learn the embedding of query words in this space by leveraging the temporal
and lexical contexts of queries.
Embedded query vectors are then clustered into tasks. Experiments demonstrate
that task extraction effectiveness is improved significantly with our proposed
method of query vector embedding in comparison to existing approaches that make
use of documents retrieved from a collection to estimate semantic similarities
between queries.
