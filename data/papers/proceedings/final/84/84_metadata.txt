Abstract#==#Using a case study, we show that variation in oral reading rate across passages
for professional narrators is consistent across readers and much of it can be
explained using features of the texts being read. While text complexity is a
poor predictor of the reading rate, a substantial share of variability can be
explained by timing and story-based factors with performance reaching r=0.75
for unseen passages and narrator.
