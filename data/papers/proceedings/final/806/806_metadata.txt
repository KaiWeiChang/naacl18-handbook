Abstract#==#Sluice resolution in English is the problem of finding antecedents of {\em
wh}-fronted ellipses. Previous work has relied on hand-crafted features over
syntax trees that scale poorly to other languages and domains; in particular,
to dialogue, which is one of the most interesting applications of sluice
resolution. Syntactic information is arguably important for sluice resolution,
but we show that multi-task learning with partial parsing as auxiliary tasks
effectively closes the gap and buys us an additional 9\%~error reduction over
previous work. Since we are not directly relying on features from partial
parsers, our system is more robust to domain shifts, giving a 26\%~error
reduction on embedded sluices in dialogue.
