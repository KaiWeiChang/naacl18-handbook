Abstract#==#Analyzing language in context, both from a theoretical and from a computational
perspective, is receiving increased interest. Complementing the research in
linguistics on discourse and information structure, in computational
linguistics identifying discourse concepts was also shown to improve the
performance of certain applications, for example, Short Answer Assessment
systems (Ziai and Meurers, 2014).

Building on the research that established detailed annotation guidelines for
manual annotation of information structural concepts for written (Dipper et
al., 2007; Ziai and Meurers, 2014) and spoken language data (Calhoun et al.,
2010), this paper presents the first approach automating the analysis of focus
in authentic written data. Our classification approach combines a range of
lexical, syntactic, and semantic features to achieve an accuracy of 78.1% for
identifying focus.
