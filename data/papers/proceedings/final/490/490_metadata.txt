Abstract#==#The task of automatic text summarization is to generate a short text that
summarizes the most important information in a given set of documents. Sentence
regression is an emerging branch in automatic text summarizations. Its key idea
is to estimate the importance of information via learned utility scores for
individual sentences. These scores are then used for selecting sentences from
the source documents, typically according to a greedy selection strategy.
Recently proposed state-of-the-art models learn to predict ROUGE recall scores
of individual sentences, which seems reasonable since the final summaries are
evaluated according to ROUGE recall. In this paper, we show in extensive
experiments that following this intuition leads to suboptimal results and that
learning to predict ROUGE precision scores leads to better results. The crucial
difference is to aim not at covering as much information as possible but at
wasting as little space as possible in every greedy step.
