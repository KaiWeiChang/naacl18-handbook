Abstract#==#Although transfer learning has been shown to be successful for tasks like
object and speech recognition, its applicability to question answering (QA) has
yet to be well-studied. In this paper, we conduct extensive experiments to
investigate the transferability of knowledge learned from a source QA dataset
to a target dataset using two QA models. The performance of both models on a
TOEFL listening comprehension test (Tseng et al., 2016) and MCTest (Richardson
et al., 2013) is significantly improved via a simple transfer learning
technique from MovieQA (Tapaswi et al., 2016). In particular, one of the models
achieves the state-of-the-art on all target datasets; for the TOEFL listening
comprehension test, it outperforms the previous best model by 7%. Finally, we
show that transfer learning is helpful even in unsupervised scenarios when
correct answers for target QA dataset examples are not available.
