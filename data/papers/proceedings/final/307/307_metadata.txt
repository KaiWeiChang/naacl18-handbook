Abstract#==#Dynamic topic modeling facilitates the identification of topical trends over time in temporal collections of unstructured documents.
We introduce a novel unsupervised neural dynamic topic model named as Recurrent Neural
Network-Replicated Softmax Model (RNNRSM), where the discovered topics at each
time influence the topic discovery in the subsequent time steps. We account for the temporal ordering of documents by explicitly modeling a joint distribution of latent topical dependencies over time, using distributional estimators with temporal recurrent connections.
Applying RNN-RSM to 19 years of articles
on NLP research, we demonstrate that compared to state-of-the art topic models, RNNRSM shows better generalization, topic interpretation, evolution and trends. We also introduce a metric (named as SPAN) to quantify the
capability of dynamic topic model to capture
word evolution in topics over time.
