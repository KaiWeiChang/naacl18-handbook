Abstract#==#Automatic colorization is the process of adding color to greyscale images. We
condition this process on language, allowing end users to manipulate a
colorized image by feeding in different captions. We present two different
architectures for language-conditioned colorization, both of which produce more
accurate and plausible colorizations than a language-agnostic version.
Furthermore, we demonstrate through crowdsourced experiments that we can
dramatically alter colorizations simply by manipulating descriptive color words
in captions.
