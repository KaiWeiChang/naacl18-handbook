Abstract#==#Semi-supervised bootstrapping techniques for
relationship extraction from text iteratively expand a set of initial seed instances. Due to the
lack of labeled data, a key challenge in bootstrapping is semantic drift: if a false positive
instance is added during an iteration, then all
following iterations are contaminated. We introduce BREX, a new bootstrapping method
that protects against such contamination by
highly effective confidence assessment. This
is achieved by using entity and template seeds
jointly (as opposed to just one as in previous
work), by expanding entities and templates in
parallel and in a mutually constraining fashion in each iteration and by introducing higherquality similarity measures for templates. Experimental results show that BREX achieves
an F1 that is 0.13 (0.87 vs. 0.74) better than
the state of the art for four relationships.
