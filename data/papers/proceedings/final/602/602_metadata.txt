Abstract#==#We consider the task of text attribute transfer: transforming a sentence to
alter a specific attribute (e.g., sentiment) while preserving its
attribute-independent content (e.g., "screen is just the right size" to "screen
is too small"). Our training data includes only sentences labeled with their
attribute (e.g., positive and negative), but not pairs of sentences that only
differ in the attributes, so we must learn to disentangle attributes from
attribute-independent content in an unsupervised way. Previous work using
adversarial methods has struggled to produce high-quality outputs. In this
paper, we propose simpler methods motivated by the observation that text
attributes are often marked by distinctive phrases (e.g., "too small"). Our
strongest method extracts content words by deleting phrases associated with the
sentence's original attribute value, retrieves new phrases associated with the
target attribute, and uses a neural model to fluently combine these into a
final output. Based on human evaluation, our best method generates grammatical
and appropriate responses on 22% more inputs than the best previous system,
averaged over three attribute transfer datasets: altering sentiment of reviews
on Yelp, altering sentiment of reviews on Amazon, and altering image captions
to be more romantic or humorous.
