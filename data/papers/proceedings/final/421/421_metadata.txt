Abstract#==#Coding EMRs with diagnosis and procedure codes is an indispensable task for
billing, secondary data analyses, and monitoring health trends. Both speed and
accuracy of coding are critical. While coding errors could lead to more
patient-side financial burden and misinterpretation of a patient's well-being,
timely coding is also needed to avoid backlogs and additional costs for the
healthcare facility. In this paper, we present a new neural network
architecture that combines ideas from few-shot learning matching networks,
multi-label loss functions, and convolutional neural networks for text
classification to significantly outperform other state-of-the-art models. Our
evaluations are conducted using a well known de-identified EMR dataset (MIMIC)
with a variety of multi-label performance measures.
