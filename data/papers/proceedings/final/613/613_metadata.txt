Abstract#==#This paper presents a new corpus and a robust deep learning architecture for a
task in reading comprehension, passage completion, on multiparty dialog. Given
a dialog in text and a passage containing factual descriptions about the dialog
where mentions of the characters are replaced by blanks, the task is to fill
the blanks with the most appropriate character names that reflect the contexts
in the dialog. Since there is no dataset that challenges the task of passage
completion in this genre, we create a corpus by selecting transcripts from a TV
show that comprise 1,681 dialogs, generating passages for each dialog through
crowdsourcing, and annotating mentions of characters in both the dialog and the
passages. Given this dataset, we build a deep neural model that integrates rich
feature extraction from convolutional neural networks into sequence modeling in
recurrent neural networks, optimized by utterance and dialog level attentions.
Our model outperforms the previous state-of-the-art model on this task in a
different genre using bidirectional LSTM, showing a 13.0+\% improvement for
longer dialogs. Our analysis shows the effectiveness of the attention
mechanisms and suggests a direction to machine comprehension on multiparty
dialog.
