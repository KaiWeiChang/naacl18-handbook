Abstract#==#We address the detection of abusive words. The task is to identify such words
among a set of negative polar expressions. We propose novel features
employing information from both corpora and lexical resources. These features
are calibrated on a small manually annotated base lexicon which we use to
produce a large lexicon. We show that the word-level information we learn
cannot be equally derived from a large dataset of annotated microposts. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our (domain-independent) lexicon in the
cross-domain detection of abusive microposts.
