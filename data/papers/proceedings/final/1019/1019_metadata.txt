Abstract#==#Neural network models, based on the attentional encoder-decoder model, have
good capability in abstractive text summarization. However, these models are
hard to be controlled in the process of generation, which leads to a lack of
key information. We propose a guiding generation model that combines the
extractive method and the abstractive method. Firstly, we obtain keywords from
the text by a extractive model. Then, we introduce a Key Information Guide
Network (KIGN), which encodes the keywords to the key information
representation, to guide the process of generation. In addition, we use a
prediction-guide mechanism, which can obtain the long-term value for future
decoding, to further guide the summary generation. We evaluate our model on the
CNN/Daily Mail dataset. The experimental results show that our model leads to
significant improvements.
