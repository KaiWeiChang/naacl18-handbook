Abstract#==#We propose USim, a semantic measure for Grammatical Error Correction (that
measures the semantic faithfulness of the output to the source, thereby
complementing existing reference-less measures (RLMs) for measuring the
output's grammaticality. USim operates by comparing the semantic symbolic
structure of the source and the correction, without relying on manually-curated
references. Our experiments establish the validity of {\sc USim}, by showing
that the semantic structures can be consistently applied to ungrammatical text,
that valid corrections obtain a high {\sc USim} similarity score to the source,
and that invalid corrections obtain a lower score.
