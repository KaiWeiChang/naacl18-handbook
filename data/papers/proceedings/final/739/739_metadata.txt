Abstract#==#We propose a novel data augmentation for labeled sentences called contextual
augmentation.
We assume an invariance that sentences are natural even if the words in the
sentences are replaced with other words with paradigmatic relations.
We stochastically replace words with other words that are predicted by a
bi-directional language model at the word positions.
Words predicted according to a context are numerous but appropriate for the
augmentation of the original words.
Furthermore, we retrofit a language model with a label-conditional
architecture, which allows the model to augment sentences without breaking the
label-compatibility.
Through the experiments for six various different text classification tasks, we
demonstrate that the proposed method improves classifiers based on the
convolutional or recurrent neural networks.
