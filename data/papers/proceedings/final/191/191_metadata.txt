Abstract#==#Question answering (QA) and question generation (QG) are closely related tasks
that could improve each other; however, the connection of these two tasks is
not well explored in literature. In this paper, we give a systematic study that
seeks to leverage the connection to improve both QA and QG. We present a
training algorithm that generalizes both Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)
and Generative Domain-Adaptive Nets (GDAN) under the question answering
scenario. The two key ideas are improving the QG model with QA through
incorporating additional QA-specific signal as the loss function, and improving
the QA model with QG through adding artificially generated training instances.
We conduct experiments on both document based and knowledge based question
answering tasks. We have two main findings. Firstly, the performance of a QG
model (e.g in terms of BLEU score) could be easily improved by a QA model via
policy gradient. Secondly, directly applying GAN that regards all the generated
questions as negative instances could not improve the accuracy of the QA model.
Learning when to regard generated questions as positive instances could bring
performance boost.
