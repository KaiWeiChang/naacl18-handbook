Abstract#==#In recent past, social media has emerged as an active platform in the context
of healthcare and medicine. In this paper, we present a study where medical
user’s opinions on health-related issues are analyzed to capture the medical
sentiment at a blog level. The medical sentiments can be studied in various
facets such as medical condition, treatment, and medication that characterize
the overall health status of the user. Considering these facets, we treat
analysis of this information as a multi-task classiﬁcation problem. In this
paper, we adopt a novel adversarial learning approach for our multi-task
learning framework to learn the sentiment’s strengths expressed in a medical
blog. Our evaluation shows promising results for our target tasks.
