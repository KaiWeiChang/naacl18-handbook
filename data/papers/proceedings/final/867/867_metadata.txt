Abstract#==#This work introduces a new strategy to compare the numerous                       

  conventions that have been proposed over the years for                       

  expressing dependency structures and discover the one for which a               

  parser will achieve the highest parsing performance. Instead of               

  associating each sentence in the training set with a single gold               

  reference we propose to consider a set of references encoding                

  alternative syntactic representations. Training a parser with a               

  dynamic oracle will then automatically select among all alternatives               

  the reference that will be predicted with the highest accuracy.               

  Experiments on the UD corpora show the validity of this approach.
