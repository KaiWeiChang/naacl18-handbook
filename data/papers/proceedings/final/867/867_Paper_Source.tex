\section{Introduction}

Multiple annotation conventions have been proposed over the years for
representing dependency
structures~\cite{hajic01prague,demarneffe14universal}. %\todo{FY: + non-projective deps and projectivization}
The divergence between annotation guidelines can result from the
theoretical linguistic principles governing the choices of head status
and dependency inventories, the tree-to-dependency conversion scheme
or arbitrary decisions regarding closed class words, such as
interjections or discursive markers, the syntactic role of which is
debatable. Several works have shown that the choice of a dependency
structure can have a large impact on parsing
performance~\cite{silveira15does,delhoneux2016representation,kohita17multilingual}
and on the performance of downstream
applications~\cite{elming13downstream}.

A natural way to decide which syntactic representation is the
best is to choose the one for which a standard parser will achieve the
highest parsing
performance~\cite{schwartz12learnability,husain12analyzing,noro05evalaution}. Implementing
this general principle faces two challenges: \textit{i)} defining a
learning criterion that can predict which dependency structure will be
the easiest to learn \textit{ii)} finding a way to explore a
potentially large number of annotation schemes that describe all
combinations of several design decisions.

This work shows that the dynamic oracle of
\newcite{goldberg13training} can straightforwardly uncover the most
\emph{learnable} dependency representation among a predefined set of
possible references.\footnote{Contrary to unsupervised parsing, our
  approach does not aim at discovering a dependency structure and
  rather relies on the existence of several hand-crafted references.}
Rather than associating each sentence in the training set to a single
reference, we propose to consider a set of references encoding
alternative syntactic representations. Training a parser with a
dynamic oracle will then automatically select among all alternatives
the reference that will be predicted with the highest accuracy.

This article is organized as follows: we first review standard
structural transformations studied in the literature that will be used
to build a treebank annotated with multiple references
(\textsection\ref{sec:transfo}). We then show how the dynamic oracle
of~\newcite{goldberg13training} can be used to train a parser when
each sentence is associated to a set of references and explain how
it can be used to define a learnability criteria
(\textsection\ref{sec:training}). An experimental evaluation of our
approach is presented in~\textsection\ref{sec:exp}.

\section{Dependency Transformations \label{sec:transfo}}

In this section, we explain how to automatically transform the
reference UD treebanks~\cite{nivre16universal}, to build corpora
in which each sentence is annotated by a set of possible trees.

The UD project aims at developing cross-linguistically consistent
treebank annotations for many languages by harmonizing annotation
schemes between languages and converting existing treebanks to this
new scheme. Several recent
papers~\cite{kohita17multilingual,delhoneux2016representation,silveira15does,popel13coordination}
have investigated whether the choices made to increase the sharing of
structures between languages hurt parsing performance and have
identified a variety of choice points in which more than one design
could be advocated. Most of these points are related to the issue of
headness: contrary to most works in theoretical linguistic, UD assumes
that function words should be categorically subordinated to content
words to maximize the similarity of dependency trees across
languages~\cite{osborne15historical}.

The alternative representations we consider are summarized in
Table~\ref{tab:udscheme}. They mostly consist in demoting the lexical
head and making it dependent on a functional head.  We designed a set
of handcrafted rules\footnote{A more detailed description of the
  transformations can be found in \cite{wisniewski17}. The source code
  is freely available on the first author web site.} to convert
dependencies between these two schemes.  Each application of a rule
creates a new tree in the set of references that is being built. As
shown in Figure~\ref{fig:ex_transfo}, the resulting set of
references encodes all possible combinations of the considered
transformations.

\section{Training a Dependency Parser with Multiple References \label{sec:training}}

\paragraph*{Dynamic Oracle} In a transition-based
parser \cite{nivre08algorithms}, a parse is computed by performing a
sequence of \emph{transitions} building the parse tree in an
incremental fashion. A partially built dependency tree is represented
by a \emph{configuration} $c$; when in $c$, applying a transition~$t$ 
results in the parser moving to a new configuration
denoted~$c \circ t$.

At each step of the parsing process, every possible transition is
scored by a classifier (e.g.\ a linear model), given a feature
representation of $c$ and model parameters $\mathbf{w}$; the score of
a \emph{derivation} (a sequence of transitions) generating a given
parse tree is the sum of its transition scores. Parsing thus amounts
to finding, starting from the initial configuration
$\textsc{Initial}(W)$, the derivation having the highest score,
typically using greedy or beam search.\footnote{In this work we only
  consider greedy parsers. Extending the proposed approach to beam
  parsers would prevent discarding a reference because one of the its
  transition is too hard to predict (i.e. has a very low score), which
  would, intuitively, results in even better predictions.}

\begin{algorithm}[t]
  \small

  $c \leftarrow \textsc{Initial}(W)$\;
  \While{$\neg \textsc{Terminal}(c)$}{

      \mathcal{T}, \textsc{Oracle}(t, c, T) = 0\right\}$\;
    $t_p \leftarrow \argmax_{t \in \textsc{Legal}(c)} \mathbf{w} \cdot \phi(c, t)$\;
    $t_o \leftarrow \argmax_{t \in \textsc{Correct}(c)} \mathbf{w} \cdot \phi(c, t)$\; \label{line:gold}
    \eIf{$t_p \notin \textsc{Correct}$}{
      $\textsc{Update}\left(\mathbf{w}, \phi(c, t_o), \phi(c, t_p)\right)$\; \label{line:update}
      $t_\textrm{next} \leftarrow t_o$\;
    }{
      $t_\textrm{next} \leftarrow t_p$\;
    }
    $\mathcal{T} \leftarrow \left\{ T \in \mathcal{T} | \textsc{Oracle}(t_\textrm{next}, c, T)=0\right\}$\; \label{line:filter}
    $c \leftarrow c \circ t_\textrm{next}$\;
  }
  \caption{Training on one sentence with multiple references (see text
    for notations).\label{alg:learning}}
\end{algorithm}

Algorithm~\ref{alg:learning} formalizes the training procedure when
the dynamic\footnote{Algorithm~\ref{alg:learning} only uses the
  non-deterministic property of the oracle and not its
  completeness. Even if we use the most common term, `dynamic
  oracle', our approach only requires the former property.}  oracle
of~\newcite{goldberg13training} is used: for each sentence, a parse
tree is built incrementally and at each step, if the predicted
transition prevents the creation of a gold dependency, the parameters
are updated, according, for instance, to the perceptron rule
(l.\ref{line:update}).  Erroneous transitions can efficiently be found
using the $\textsc{Oracle}(t, c, T)$ function formally defined
in~\cite{goldberg13training} as computing the number of dependencies
of a gold parse tree $T$ that can no longer be predicted when a
transition $t$ is applied in configuration $c$.

During training, it often happens that several transitions are equally good: in 
such situations, the training algorithm
breaks ties among oracle transitions according to
the model current prediction (l.\ref{line:gold}). As suggested in the
imitation learning literature~\cite{daume05learning,ross10efficient}, this
strategy enables to sample those configurations that will be the most
similar to the ones seen when predicting a new dependency tree: it is
a way to let the parser explore more specifically the part of the
search space it prefers and is more likely to see at test
time~\cite{aufrant17dont}. Using a dynamic oracle usually results in
substantial improvements in accuracy compared to static oracles.

\paragraph*{Considering Multiple References} Implementing the training
algorithm described above only requires the ability to detect whether
a transition will cause an erroneous dependency. It can naturally be
extended to the case of multiple references: a transition is
considered correct as long as it can predict at least one of the gold
trees; when moving to a new configuration, trees that can no longer be
generated are removed from the set of references, in order to make
sure the parser will not mix the dependencies of two gold trees
(l.\ref{line:filter}).

Upon full completion of parsing, there will remain only one surviving
reference that has been selected \emph{according to the model current
  predictions}. This reference corresponds to the dependency structure
that is the most similar to the hypothesis the parser would have
predicted at test time and can therefore be described as the reference
the parser prefers: intuitively, Algorithm~\ref{alg:learning} will thus
identify the reference that will be predicted with the highest
accuracy.

\section{Experiments \label{sec:exp}}

\paragraph*{Data} We separately apply to the 7 dependencies considered
the transformations described in Section~\ref{sec:transfo} on the
38~languages of the UD project (v1.3), resulting in 266~transformed
corpora.\footnote{44 transformed corpora were identical to the
  original corpora as the transformation can not be applied (e.g.\
  there are no multi-word expression in Chinese).}  To evaluate the
ability of the proposed method to identify the `best' dependency
structure, we consider fully as well as partially transformed
sentences: a sentence with $n$ dependencies of interest will generate
$2^n$ references.

For each condition (i.e.\ a language and a transformation), a dependency
parser is trained using (a) the original data annotated with UD
convention, (b) `transformed' data in which each sentence is
associated to a reference in which all dependencies of interest have
been transformed and (c) the data associated with a set of reference
containing all the partially transformed references (including the
original and transformed references).

\paragraph*{Parser} We use our own implementation of an arc-eager
unlabeled dependency parser with a dynamic oracle and an averaged
perceptron, using the features described in~\cite{zhang11transition}
which have been designed for English and have not been adapted to the
specificities of the other languages.\footnote{Note that the proposed
  approach can be apply to other transition systems and classifiers.}
Training stops when the UAS estimated on the validation set has
converged.

\paragraph*{Impact of Transformations}
Figure~\ref{fig:distrib_uas_diff} shows the distribution of
differences in UAS between a parser trained on the original data
(setting (a)) and a parser trained on the transformed data (setting
(b)). To evaluate the proposed transformations, we follow the approach
introduced in \cite{schwartz12learnability} consisting in comparing
the original and the transformed data on their respective
references.% \todo{FY: A footnote pour future work - check whether it also
  % improves on original tree ?}

As expected, the annotation scheme has a large impact on the quality
of the prediction, with an average difference in scores of 0.66 UAS
points and variations as large as 8.1~UAS points. These results show
that, contrary to general
belief~\cite{schwartz12learnability,kohita17multilingual}, the UD
scheme is not sub-optimal for monolingual parsing: the difference in
UAS is negative in 93 conditions and positive in
129. Table~\ref{tab:uas_diff} details for each dependency the when the
UD scheme results in better predictions.

\end{table}

% XXX do not forget to add reference to UDW'17 paper

\paragraph*{Training with Multiple References}
To assess the impact of training with multiple references (setting
(c)), we first evaluate the capacity of Algorithm~\ref{alg:learning}
to consistently select a single annotation scheme during training. We
count, in each conditions, the number of times the reference that has
survived training was following the original scheme and the number of
times it was following the transformed scheme. For 74.7\% of the
conditions, the reference that has survived training was following the
same annotation scheme for more than 70\% of the training examples. This
observation proves the ability of the parser to commit itself to a
single annotation scheme.

\paragraph*{Learnability Criterion} The training procedure proposed in
this article was designed to uncover the dependency structure that will
optimize parsing accuracy. In this section we evaluate whether this goal is achieved, 
by counting the number of conditions in which the
annotation scheme that has survived training the most often (in
setting (c)) is indeed the one that achieves the best performance on
the test set, as evaluated by testing a parser in settings (a) and
(b).

We will consider, as baselines, two measures of the `learnability' of
a treebank, the \emph{predictability} of an annotation
scheme~\cite{schwartz12learnability} and the \emph{derivation
  perplexity}~\cite{sogaard10derivation}. Contrary to our
approach, these two measures aims at deciding which of two annotations
schemes will achieve the best parsing accuracy without actually
training and testing a parser.  The predictability is defined as the
entropy of the conditional distribution of the dependent PoS 
knowing the head PoS.  The derivation perplexity is the
perplexity of 3-gram language model estimated on a corpus in which the
words of a sentence appear in the order in which they are attached to
their head.\footnote{Similarly to~\cite{sogaard10derivation}, we
  consider a trigram language model but use Witten-Bell smoothing as
  many corpora are too small to use Kneser-Ney smoothing.}

Table~\ref{tab:learnability} reports the number of times, averaged
over languages and transformations, that each measure of learnability
is able to predict which of two competing annotation schemes will
yield the best parsing performance. These results clearly show that the approach we propose to
evaluate the `learnability' of an annotation scheme outperforms
existing criteria

\section{Conclusion}

This work introduces a new strategy to compare the numerous
representations that have been proposed over the years for expressing
dependency structures and discover the one that is easiest to learn.
Experiments with the popular transition-based parser on the UD corpora
show the validity of the proposed approach. 

In future work, we would like to evaluate the impact of annotation
conventions on other kind of parsers and to find the properties of a
dependency tree that facilitate its prediction. We also plan to find
ways to easily annotate sentences with multiple references (e.g. by
indicating that the head of word can be chosen arbitrarily) and
eliminate the constraint that references should be trees.
