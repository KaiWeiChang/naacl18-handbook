Abstract#==#Entrainment has been shown to occur for various linguistic features individually. Motivated
by cognitive theories regarding linguistic entrainment, we analyze speakersâ€™ overall entrainment behaviors and search for an underlying structure. We consider various measures
of both acoustic-prosodic and lexical entrainment, measuring the latter with a novel application of two previously introduced methods in addition to a standard high-frequency
word measure. We present a negative result of our search, finding no meaningful correlations, clusters, or principal components in various entrainment measures, and discuss practical and theoretical implications.
