Abstract#==#Creating accurate meta-embeddings from pre-trained source embeddings has
received attention lately.
Methods based on global and locally-linear transformation and concatenation
have shown to produce accurate meta-embeddings.
In this paper, we show that the arithmetic mean of two distinct word embedding
sets yields a
performant meta-embedding that is comparable or better than more complex
meta-embedding learning methods.
The result seems counter-intuitive given that vector spaces in different source
embeddings are not comparable and cannot be simply averaged. We give insight
into why averaging can still produce accurate meta-embedding despite the
incomparability of the source vector spaces.
