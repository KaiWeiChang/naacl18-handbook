Abstract#==#Reasoning is a crucial part of natural language argumentation. To comprehend an
argument, one must analyze its warrant, which explains why its claim follows
from its premises. As arguments are highly contextualized, warrants are usually
presupposed and left implicit. Thus, the comprehension does not only require
language understanding and logic skills, but also depends on common sense. In
this paper we develop a methodology for reconstructing warrants systematically.
We operationalize it in a scalable crowdsourcing process, resulting in a freely
licensed dataset with warrants for 2k authentic arguments from news comments.
On this basis, we present a new challenging task, the argument reasoning
comprehension task. Given an argument with a claim and a premise, the goal is
to choose the correct implicit warrant from two options. Both warrants are
plausible and lexically close, but lead to contradicting claims. A solution to
this task will define a substantial step towards automatic warrant
reconstruction. However, experiments with several neural attention and language
models reveal that current approaches do not suffice.
