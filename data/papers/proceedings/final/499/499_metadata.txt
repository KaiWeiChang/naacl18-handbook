Abstract#==#Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) annotations are often assumed to closely
mirror dependency syntax, but AMR explicitly does not require this, and the
assumption has never been tested. To test it, we devise an expressive framework
to align AMR graphs to dependency graphs, which we use to annotate 200 AMRs.
Our annotation explains how 97% of AMR edges are evoked by words or syntax.
Previously existing AMR alignment frameworks did not allow for mapping AMR onto
syntax, and as a consequence they explained at most 23%. While we find that
there are indeed many cases where AMR annotations closely mirror syntax, there
are also pervasive differences. We use our annotations to test a baseline
AMR-to-syntax aligner, finding that this task is more difficult than
AMR-to-string alignment; and to pinpoint errors in an AMR parser. We make our
data and code freely available for further research on AMR parsing and
generation, and the relationship of AMR to syntax.
