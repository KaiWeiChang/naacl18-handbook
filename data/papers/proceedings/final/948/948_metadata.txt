Abstract#==#We generalize Cohen, Gómez-Rodríguez, and Satta's (2011) parser to a family
of non-projective transition-based dependency parsers allowing polynomial-time
exact inference. This includes novel parsers with better coverage than Cohen et
al. (2011), and even a variant that reduces time complexity to O(n^6),
improving over the known bounds in exact inference for non-projective
transition-based parsing. We hope that this piece of theoretical work inspires
design of novel transition systems with better coverage and better run-time
guarantees.
