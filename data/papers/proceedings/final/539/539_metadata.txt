Abstract#==#We present a new approach to learning a semantic parser from multiple datasets,
even when the target semantic formalisms are drastically different and the
underlying corpora do not overlap. We handle such ``disjoint'' data by treating
annotations for unobserved formalisms as latent structured variables. Building
on state-of-the-art baselines, we show improvements both in frame-semantic
parsing and semantic dependency parsing by modeling them jointly.
