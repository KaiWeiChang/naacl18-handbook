Abstract#==#We introduce a fully-differentiable approximation to higher-order inference for
coreference resolution. Our approach uses the antecedent distribution from a
span-ranking architecture as an attention mechanism to iteratively refine span
representations. This enables the model to softly consider multiple hops in the
predicted clusters. To alleviate the computational cost of this iterative
process, we introduce a coarse-to-fine approach that incorporates a less
accurate but more efficient bilinear factor, enabling more aggressive pruning
without hurting accuracy. Compared to the existing state-of-the-art
span-ranking approach, our model significantly improves accuracy on the English
OntoNotes benchmark, while being far more computationally efficient.
