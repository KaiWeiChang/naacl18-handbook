Abstract#==#Emotion recognition in conversations is crucial for the development of empathetic machines. Present methods mostly ignore the role of inter-speaker dependency relations while classifying emotions in conversations. In this paper, we address recognizing utterance-level emotions in dyadic conversational videos. We propose a deep neural framework, termed Conversational Memory Network (CMN), which leverages contextual information from the conversation history. In particular, CMN uses
multimodal approach comprising audio, visual and textual features with gated recurrent units to model past utterances of each speaker into memories. These memories
are then merged using attention-based hops to capture inter-speaker dependencies. Experiments show a significant improvement of 3 âˆ’ 4% in accuracy over the state of the art.
