Abstract#==#In this paper, we propose a generalizable dialog generation approach that
adapts multi-turn reasoning, one recent advancement in the field of document
comprehension, to generate responses ("answers") by taking current conversation
session context as a "document" and current query as a "question". The major
idea is to represent a conversation session into memories upon which
attention-based memory reading mechanism can be performed multiple times, so
that (1) user's query is properly extended by contextual clues and (2) optimal
responses are step-by-step generated. Considering that the speakers of one
conversation are not limited to be one, we separate the single memory used for
document comprehension into different groups for speaker-specific topic and
opinion embedding. Namely, we utilize the queries' memory, the responses'
memory, and their unified memory, following the time sequence of the
conversation session. Experiments on Japanese 10-sentence (5-round)
conversation modeling show impressive results on how multi-turn reasoning can
produce more diverse and acceptable responses than state-of-the-art single-turn
and non-reasoning baselines.
