Abstract#==#Wit is a form of rich interaction that is often grounded in a specific
situation (e.g., a comment in response to an event). In this work, we attempt
to build computational models that can produce witty descriptions for a given
image. Inspired by a cognitive account of humor appreciation, we employ
linguistic wordplay, specifically puns, in image descriptions. 
We develop two approaches which involve retrieving witty descriptions for a
given image from a large corpus of sentences, or generating them via an
encoder-decoder neural network architecture.
We compare our approach against meaningful baseline approaches via human
studies and show substantial improvements.
Moreover, in a Turing test style evaluation, people find the image descriptions
generated by our model to be slightly wittier than human-written witty
descriptions when the human is subject to similar constraints as the model
regarding word usage and style.
