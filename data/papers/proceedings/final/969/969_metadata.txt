Abstract#==#Large-scale datasets for natural language inference are created by presenting
crowd workers with a sentence (premise), and asking them to generate three new
sentences (hypotheses) that it entails, contradicts, or is logically neutral
with respect to. We show that, in a significant portion of such data, this
protocol leaves clues that make it possible to identify the label by looking
only at the hypothesis, without observing the premise. Specifically, we show
that a simple text categorization model can correctly classify the hypothesis
alone in about 67% of SNLI (Bowman et. al, 2015) and 53% of MultiNLI (Williams
et. al, 2017). Our analysis reveals that specific linguistic phenomena such as
negation and vagueness are highly correlated with certain inference classes.
Our findings suggest that the success of natural language inference models to
date has been overestimated, and that the task remains a hard open problem.
