Abstract#==#This paper presents a corpus and experiments to mine possession relations from
text. Specifically, we target alienable and control possessions, and assign
temporal anchors indicating when the possession holds between possessor and
possessee. We present new annotations for this task, and experimental results
using both traditional classifiers and neural networks. Results show that the
three subtasks (predicting possession existence, possession type and temporal
anchors) can be automated.
