Abstract#==#Recently, neural machine translation (NMT) has emerged as a powerful alterna- tive to conventional statistical approaches. However, its performance drops consider- ably in the presence of morphologically rich languages (MRLs). Neural engines usually fail to tackle the large vocabulary and high out-of-vocabulary (OOV) word rate of MRLs. Therefore, it is not suitable to exploit existing word-based models to translate this set of languages. In this paper, we propose an extension to the state-of-the-art model of Chung et al. (2016), which works at the character level and boosts the decoder with target-side morphological information. In our archi- tecture, an additional morphology table is plugged into the model. Each time the decoder samples from a target vocabulary, the table sends auxiliary signals from the most relevant affixes in order to enrich the decoderâ€™s current state and constrain it to provide better predictions. We evaluated our model to translate English into Ger- man, Russian, and Turkish as three MRLs and observed significant improvements.
