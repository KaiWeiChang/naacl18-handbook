Abstract#==#We study the problem of analyzing tweets with universal dependencies (UD). We
extend the UD guidelines to cover special constructions in tweets that affect
tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, and labeled dependencies. Using the extended
guidelines, we create a new tweet treebank for English (Tweebank v2) that is four times
larger than the (unlabeled) Tweebank v1 introduced by Kong et al. (2014). We
characterize the disagreements between our annotators and show that it is
challenging to deliver consistent annotation due to ambiguity in understanding
and explaining tweets. Nonetheless, using the new treebank, we build a pipeline
system to parse raw tweets into UD. To overcome the annotation noise without
sacrificing computational efficiency, we propose a new method to distill an
ensemble of 20 transition-based parsers into a single one. Our parser achieves
an improvement of 2.2 in LAS over the un-ensembled baseline 
and outperforms parsers that are state-of-the-art on other treebanks in both
accuracy and speed.
