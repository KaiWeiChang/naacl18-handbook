Abstract#==#Morphological segmentation for polysynthetic
languages is challenging, because
a word may consist of many individual
morphemes and training data can be extremely
scarce. Since neural sequence-to-sequence
(seq2seq) models define the
state of the art for morphological segmentation
in high-resource settings and
for (mostly) European languages, we first
show that they also obtain competitive performance
for Mexican polysynthetic languages
in minimal-resource settings. We
then propose two novel multi-task training
approaches—one with, one without
need for external unlabeled resources—,
and two corresponding data augmentation
methods, improving over the neural baseline
for all languages. Finally, we explore
cross-lingual transfer as a third way to fortify
our neural model and show that we can
train one single multi-lingual model for
related languages while maintaining comparable
or even improved performance,
thus reducing the amount of parameters by
close to 75%. We provide our morphological
segmentation datasets for Mexicanero,
Nahuatl, Wixarika and Yorem Nokki for
future research.
