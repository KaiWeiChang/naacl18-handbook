Abstract#==#Online reviews have become a popular portal among customers making decisions
about purchasing products. A number of corpora of reviews have been widely
investigated in NLP
in general, and, in particular, in argument mining. This is a subset of NLP
that deals with
extracting arguments and the relations among them from user-based content. A
major problem faced by argument mining research is the lack of human-annotated
data. In this paper, we investigate the use of weakly supervised and
semi-supervised methods for automatically annotating data, and thus providing
large annotated datasets. We do this by building on previous work that explores
the classification of opinions present in reviews based
whether the stance is expressed explicitly or implicitly. In the work described
here, we automatically annotate stance as implicit or explicit and our results
show that the datasets
we generate, although noisy, can be used to learn better models for
implicit/explicit opinion classification.
