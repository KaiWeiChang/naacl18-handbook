Abstract#==#In formal logic-based approaches to Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE), a
Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG) parser is used to parse input premises and
hypotheses to obtain their logical formulas. Here, it is important that the
parser
processes the sentences consistently; failing to recognize the similar
syntactic structure results in inconsistent predicate argument structures among
them, in which case the succeeding theorem proving is doomed to failure. In
this work, we present a simple method to extend an existing CCG parser to parse
a set of
sentences consistently, which is achieved with an inter-sentence modeling with
Markov Random Fields (MRF). When combined with existing logic-based systems,
our method always shows improvement in the RTE experiments
on English and Japanese languages.
