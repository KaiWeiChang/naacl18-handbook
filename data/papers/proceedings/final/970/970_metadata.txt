Abstract#==#Recent research in language and vision has developed models for predicting and
disambiguating verbs from images. Here, we ask whether the predictions made by
such models correspond to human intuitions about visual verbs. We show that the
image regions a verb prediction model identifies as salient for a given verb
correlate with the regions fixated by human observers performing a verb
classification task.
