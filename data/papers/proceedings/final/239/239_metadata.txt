Abstract#==#Storyline generation aims to extract events described on news articles under a
certain news topic and reveal how those events evolve over time. Most
approaches to storyline generation first train supervised models to extract
events from news articles published in different time periods and then link
relevant extracted events into coherent stories. They are domain dependent and
cannot deal with unseen event types. To tackle this problem, approaches based
on probabilistic graphic models jointly model the generations of events and
storylines without the use of annotated data. However, the parameter inference
procedure is too complex and models often require long time to converge. In
this paper, we propose a novel neural network based approach to extract
structured representations and evolution patterns of storylines without using
annotated data. In this model, title and main body of a news article are
assumed to share the similar storyline distribution. Moreover, similar
documents described in neighboring time periods are assumed to share similar
storyline distributions. Based on these assumptions, structured representations
and evolution patterns of storylines can be extracted. The proposed model has
been evaluated on three news corpora and the experimental results show that it
outperforms state-of-the-art approaches for storyline generation on both
accuracy and efficiency.
