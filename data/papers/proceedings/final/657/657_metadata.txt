Abstract#==#Entity Linking (EL) systems aim to automatically map mentions of an entity in text to the
corresponding entity in a Knowledge Graph (KG). Degree of connectivity of an entity in
the KG directly affects an EL system’s ability to correctly link mentions in text to the
entity in KG. This causes many EL systems to perform well for entities well connected
to other entities in KG, bringing into focus the role of KG density in EL. In this paper,
we propose Entity Linking using Densified Knowledge Graphs (ELDEN). ELDEN is an
EL system which first densifies the KG with co-occurrence statistics from a large text cor-
pus, and then uses the densified KG to train entity embeddings. Entity similarity measured
using these trained entity embeddings result in improved EL. ELDEN outperforms state-
of-the-art EL system on benchmark datasets. Due to such densification, ELDEN performs
well for sparsely connected entities in the KG too. ELDEN’s approach is simple, yet effec-
tive. We have made ELDEN’s code and data publicly available.
