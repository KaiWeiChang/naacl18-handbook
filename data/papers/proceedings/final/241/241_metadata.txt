Abstract#==#Single document summarization is the task of producing a shorter
version of a document while preserving its principal information
content.  In this paper we conceptualize extractive summarization as a
sentence ranking task and propose a novel training algorithm which
globally optimizes the ROUGE evaluation metric through a reinforcement
learning objective.  We use our algorithm to train a neural
summarization model on the CNN and DailyMail datasets and demonstrate
experimentally that it outperforms state-of-the-art extractive and
abstractive systems when evaluated automatically and by humans.
