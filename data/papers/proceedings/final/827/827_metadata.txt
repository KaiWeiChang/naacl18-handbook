Abstract#==#This paper presents the first AMR parser built on the Chinese AMR bank. By
applying a transition-based AMR parsing framework to Chinese, we first
investigate how well the transitions first designed for English AMR parsing
generalize to Chinese and provide a comparative analysis between the
transitions for English and Chinese. We then perform a detailed error analysis
to identify the major challenges in Chinese AMR parsing that we hope will
inform future research in this area.
