Abstract#==#Pleonasms are words that are redundant. To aid the development of systems that detect
pleonasms in text, we introduce an annotated corpus of semantic pleonasms. We validate
the integrity of the corpus with interannotator agreement analyses. We also compare
it against alternative resources in terms of their effects on several automatic redundancy detection methods.
