Abstract#==#People can identify correspondences between narratives in everyday life. For
example, an analogy with the Cinderella story may be made in describing the
unexpected success of an underdog in seemingly different stories. We present a
new task and dataset for story understanding: identifying instances of similar
narratives from a collection of narrative texts. We present an initial approach
for this problem, which finds correspondences between narratives in terms of
plot events, and resemblances between characters and their social
relationships. Our approach yields an 8% absolute improvement in performance
over a competitive information-retrieval baseline on a novel dataset of plot
summaries of 577 movie remakes from Wikipedia.
