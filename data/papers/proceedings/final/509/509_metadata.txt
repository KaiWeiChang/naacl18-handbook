Abstract#==#Studies in Social Sciences have revealed that when people evaluate someone
else, their evaluations often reflect their biases. As a result, rater bias may
introduce highly subjective factors that make their evaluations inaccurate.
This may affect automated essay scoring models in many ways, as these models
are typically designed to model (potentially biased) essay raters. While there
is sizeable literature on rater effects in general settings, it remains unknown
how rater bias affects automated essay scoring. To this end, we present a new
annotated corpus containing essays and their respective scores. Different from
existing corpora, our corpus also contains comments provided by the raters in
order to ground their scores. We present features to quantify rater bias based
on their comments, and we found that rater bias plays an important role in
automated essay scoring. We investigated the extent to which rater bias affects
models based on hand-crafted features. Finally, we propose to rectify the
training set by removing essays associated with potentially biased scores while
learning the scoring model.
