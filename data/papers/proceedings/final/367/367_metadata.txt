Abstract#==#We explore deception detection in interview dialogues. We analyze a set of
linguistic features in both truthful and deceptive responses to interview
questions. We also study the perception of deception, identifying
characteristics of statements that are perceived as truthful or deceptive by
interviewers. Our analysis show significant differences between truthful and
deceptive question responses, as well as variations in deception
patterns across gender and native language. This analysis motivated our
selection of features for machine learning experiments aimed at classifying
globally deceptive speech. Our best classification performance is 72.74%
F1-Score (about 17% better than human performance), which is achieved using a
combination of linguistic features and individual traits.
