Abstract#==#Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) research has mostly focused on English.
We show that it is possible to use AMR annotations for English as a semantic
representation for sentences written in other languages. We exploit an AMR
parser for English and parallel corpora to learn AMR parsers for Italian,
Spanish, German and Chinese. Qualitative analysis show that the new parsers
overcome structural differences between the languages. We further propose a
method to evaluate the parsers that does not require gold standard data in the
target languages. This method highly correlates with the gold standard
evaluation, obtaining a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.95.
