Abstract#==#Medical professionals search the published literature by specifying the type of
patients, the medical intervention(s) and the outcome measure(s) of interest.
In this paper we demonstrate how features encoding syntactic patterns improve
the performance of state-of-the-art sequence tagging models (both neural and
linear) for information extraction of these medically relevant categories. We
present an analysis of the type of patterns exploited and of the semantic space
induced for these, i.e., the distributed representations learned for identified
multi-token patterns. We show that these learned representations differ
substantially from those of the constituent unigrams, suggesting that the
patterns capture contextual information that is otherwise lost.
