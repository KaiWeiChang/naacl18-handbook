Abstract#==#Natural language generation (NLG) is a critical component in spoken dialogue
systems. 
Classic NLG can be divided into two phases: (1) sentence planning: deciding on
the overall sentence structure, (2) surface realization: determining specific
word forms and flattening the sentence structure into a string. 
Many simple NLG models are based on recurrent neural networks (RNN) and
sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) model, which basically contains a
encoder-decoder structure; these NLG models generate sentences from scratch by
jointly optimizing sentence planning and surface realization using a simple
cross entropy loss training criterion.
However, the simple encoder-decoder architecture usually suffers from
generating complex and long sentences, because the decoder has to learn all
grammar and diction knowledge.
This paper introduces a hierarchical decoding NLG model based on linguistic
patterns in different levels, and shows that the proposed method outperforms
the traditional one with a smaller model size.
Furthermore, the design of the hierarchical decoding is flexible and
easily-extendible in various NLG systems.
