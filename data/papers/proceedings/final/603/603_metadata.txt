Abstract#==#We present a reading comprehension challenge in which questions can only be
answered by taking into account information from multiple sentences. We solicit
and verify questions and answers for this challenge through a 4-step
crowdsourcing experiment. Our challenge dataset contains 6,500+ questions for
1000+ paragraphs across 7 different domains (elementary school science, news,
travel guides, fiction stories, etc) bringing in linguistic diversity to the
texts and to the questions wordings. On a subset of our dataset, we found human
solvers to achieve an F1-score of 88.1%. We analyze a range of baselines,
including a recent state-of-art reading comprehension system, and demonstrate
the difficulty of this challenge, despite a high human performance. The dataset
is the first to study multi-sentence inference at scale, with an open-ended set
of question types that requires reasoning skills.
