Abstract#==#Style transfer is the task of automatically transforming a piece of text in one
particular style into another.   A major barrier to progress in this field has
been a lack of training and evaluation datasets, as well as benchmarks and
automatic metrics.  In this work, we create the largest corpus for a particular
stylistic transfer (formality) and show that techniques from the machine
translation community can serve as strong baselines for future work.  We also
discuss challenges of using automatic metrics.
