Abstract#==#Compositional Distributional Semantic Models (CDSMs) model the meaning of
phrases and sentences in vector space. They have been predominantly evaluated
on limited, artificial tasks such as semantic sentence similarity on
hand-constructed datasets. This paper argues for lexical substitution (LexSub)
as a means to evaluate CDSMs. LexSub is a more natural task, enables us to
evaluate meaning composition at the level of individual words, and provides a
common ground to compare CDSMs with dedicated LexSub models. We create a LexSub
dataset for CDSM evaluation from a corpus with manual “all-words” LexSub
annotation. Our experiments indicate that the Practical Lexical Function CDSM
outperforms simple component-wise CDSMs and performs on par with the
context2vec LexSub model using the same context.
