Abstract#==#We introduce an approach to neural text generation that explicitly represents
entities mentioned in the text. Entity representations are vectors that are
updated as the text proceeds; they are designed specifically for narrative text
like fiction or news stories.  Our experiments demonstrate that modeling
entities offers a benefit in two automatic
evaluations: mention generation (in which a model chooses which entity to
mention next and which words to use in the mention) and selection between a
correct next sentence and a distractor from later in the same story. We also
conduct a human evaluation on automatically generated text in story contexts;
this study supports our emphasis on entities and suggests directions for
further research.
