Abstract#==#Emojis are small images that are commonly included in social media text
messages. The combination of visual and textual content in the same message
builds up a modern way of communication, that automatic systems are not used to
deal with. 
In this paper we extend recent advances in emoji prediction by putting forward
a multimodal approach that is able to predict emojis in Instagram posts.
Instagram posts are composed of pictures together with texts which  sometimes
include emojis. We show that these emojis can be predicted by using the text,
but also using the picture. Our main finding is that incorporating the two
synergistic modalities, in a combined model, improves accuracy in an emoji
prediction task. This result demonstrates that these two modalities (text and
images) encode different information on the use of emojis and therefore  can
complement each other.
