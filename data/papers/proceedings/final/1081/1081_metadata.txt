Abstract#==#We propose a simple but highly effective automatic evaluation measure of summarization, pruned Basic Elements (pBE).
Although the BE concept is widely used for the automated evaluation of summaries, its weakness is that it redundantly matches basic elements.
To avoid this redundancy, pBE prunes basic elements by (1) disregarding frequency count of basic elements and (2) reducing semantically overlapped basic elements based on word similarity.
Even though it is simple, pBE outperforms ROUGE in DUC datasets in most cases and achieves the highest rank correlation coefficient in TAC 2011 AESOP task.
