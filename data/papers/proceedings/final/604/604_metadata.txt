Abstract#==#Election manifestos document the intentions, motives, and views of political parties.
They are often used for analysing a party's fine-grained position on a particular issue, as well as for coarse-grained positioning of a party on the left--right spectrum. 
In this paper we propose a two-stage model for automatically performing both levels of analysis over manifestos. In the first step we employ a hierarchical multi-task structured deep model to predict fine- and coarse-grained positions, and in the second step we perform post-hoc calibration of coarse-grained positions using probabilistic soft logic. We empirically show that the proposed model outperforms state-of-art approaches at both granularities using manifestos from twelve countries, written in ten different languages.
