Abstract#==#Traditional approaches to semantic parsing (SP) work by training individual
models for each available parallel dataset of text-meaning pairs. In this
paper, we explore the idea of polyglot semantic translation, or learning
semantic parsing models that are trained on multiple datasets and natural
languages.  In particular, we focus on translating text to code signature
representations using the software component datasets of Richardson and Kuhn
(2017b,a). The advantage of such models is that they can be used for parsing  a
wide variety of input natural languages and output programming languages, or
mixed input languages, using a single unified model. To facilitate modeling of
this type, we develop a novel graph-based decoding framework that achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the above datasets, and apply this method to
two other benchmark SP tasks.
