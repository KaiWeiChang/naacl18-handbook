Abstract#==#NLP algorithms are increasingly used in computational
social science to take linguistic observations and predict
outcomes like human preferences or actions.
Making these social models transparent and interpretable
often requires identifying features in the input that predict
outcomes while also controlling for potential confounds.
We formalize this need as a new task: inducing a lexicon that is predictive of
a set of target variables yet uncorrelated to a set of confounding variables.
We introduce two deep learning algorithms for the task.
The first uses a bifurcated architecture to separate the explanatory power of
the
text and confounds.  The second
uses an adversarial discriminator to force confound-invariant text encodings.
Both elicit lexicons from learned weights and attentional scores. We use them
to induce lexicons that are predictive of timely responses to consumer
complaints (controlling for product), enrollment from course descriptions
(controlling for subject), and sales from product descriptions (controlling for
seller).
In each domain our algorithms pick words that are associated with
\emph{narrative persuasion}; more predictive and less confound-related than
those of standard feature weighting
and lexicon induction techniques like regression and log odds.
