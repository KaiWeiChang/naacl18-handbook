Abstract#==#Sentence simplification aims to simplify the content and structure of complex
sentences, and thus make them easier to interpret for human readers, and easier
to process for downstream NLP applications. Recent advances in neural machine
translation have paved the way for novel approaches to the task. In this paper,
we adapt an architecture with augmented memory capacities called Neural
Semantic Encoders (Munkhdalai and Yu, 2017) for sentence simplification. Our
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on different
simplification datasets, both in terms of automatic evaluation measures and
human judgments.
