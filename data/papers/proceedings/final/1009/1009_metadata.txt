Abstract#==#In this paper, we introduce a new benchmark for co-reference resolution focused
on gender bias, WinoBias. Our corpus contains Winograd-schema style sentences
with entities corresponding to people referred by their occupation (e.g. the
nurse, the doctor, the carpenter). We demonstrate that a rule-based, a
feature-rich, and a neural coreference system all link gendered pronouns to
pro-stereotypical entities with higher accuracy than anti-stereotypical
entities, by an average difference of 21.1 in F1 score. Finally, we demonstrate
a data-augmentation approach that, in combination with existing word-embedding
debiasing techniques, removes the bias demonstrated by these systems in
WinoBias without significantly affecting their performance on existing
datasets.
