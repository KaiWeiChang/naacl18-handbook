Abstract#==#This paper introduces the Multi-Genre Natural Language Inference (MultiNLI)
corpus, a dataset designed for use in the development and evaluation of machine
learning models for sentence understanding. At 433k examples,  this resource is
one of the largest corpora available for natural language inference (a.k.a.
recognizing textual entailment), improving upon available resources in both its
coverage and difficulty. MultiNLI accomplishes this by offering data from ten
distinct genres of written and spoken English, making it possible to evaluate
systems on nearly the full complexity of the language, while supplying an
explicit setting for evaluating cross-genre domain adaptation. In addition, an
evaluation using existing machine learning models designed for the Stanford NLI
corpus shows that it represents a substantially more difficult task than does
that corpus, despite the two showing similar levels of inter-annotator
agreement.
