Abstract#==#Public debate forums provide a common platform
for exchanging opinions on a topic of
interest. While recent studies in natural language
processing (NLP) have provided empirical
evidence that the language of the debaters
and their patterns of interaction play
a key role in changing the mind of a reader,
research in psychology has shown that prior
beliefs can affect our interpretation of an argument
and could therefore constitute a competing
alternative explanation for resistance to
changing oneâ€™s stance. To study the actual effect
of language use vs. prior beliefs on persuasion,
we provide a new dataset and propose a
controlled setting that takes into consideration
two reader-level factors: political and religious
ideology. We find that prior beliefs affected by
these reader-level factors play a more important
role than language use effects and argue
that it is important to account for them in NLP
studies of persuasion.
