Abstract#==#Code-switching is a phenomenon of mixing grammatical structures of two or more
languages under varied social constraints. The code-switching data differ so
radically from the benchmark corpora used in NLP community that the application
of standard technologies to these data degrades their performance sharply.
Unlike standard corpora, these data often need to go through additional
processes such as language identification, normalization and/or
back-transliteration for their efficient processing. In this paper, we
investigate these indispensable processes and other problems associated with
syntactic parsing of code-switching data and propose methods to mitigate their
effects. In particular, we study dependency parsing of code-switching data of
Hindi and English multilingual speakers from Twitter. We present a
treebank of Hindi-English code-switching tweets under Universal Dependencies
scheme and propose a neural stacking model for parsing that efficiently
leverages the part-of-speech
tag and syntactic tree annotations in the code-switching treebank and the
preexisting Hindi and English treebanks. We also present normalization and
back-transliteration models with a decoding process tailored for code-switching
data. Results show that our neural stacking parser is 1.5% LAS points better
than the augmented parsing model and 3.8% LAS points better than the one which
uses first-best normalization and/or back-transliteration.
