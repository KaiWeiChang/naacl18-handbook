Abstract#==#Cross-language article linking (CLAL) is the task of finding corresponding
article pairs of different languages across encyclopedias. This task is a
difficult disambiguation problem in which one article must be selected among
several candidate articles with similar titles and contents. Existing works
focus on engineering text-based or link-based features for this task, which is
a time-consuming job, and some of these features are only applicable within the
same encyclopedia. In this paper, we address these problems by proposing
cross-encyclopedia entity embedding. Unlike other works, our proposed method
does not rely on known cross-language pairs. We apply our method to CLAL
between English Wikipedia and Chinese Baidu Baike. Our features improve
performance relative to the baseline by 29.62%. Tested 30 times, our system
achieved an average improvement of 2.76% over the current best system (26.86%
over baseline), a statistically significant result.
