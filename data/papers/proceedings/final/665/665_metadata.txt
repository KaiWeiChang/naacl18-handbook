Abstract#==#Automatic evaluation systems in the field of automatic summarization have been
relying on the availability of gold standard summaries for over ten years. Gold
standard summaries are expensive to obtain and often require the availability
of domain experts to achieve high quality. In this paper, we propose an
alternative evaluation approach based on pairwise preferences of sentences. In
comparison to gold standard summaries, they are simpler and cheaper to obtain.
In our experiments, we show that humans are able to provide useful feedback in
the form of pairwise preferences. The new framework performs better than the
three most popular versions of ROUGE with less expensive human input. We also
show that our framework can reuse already available evaluation data and achieve
even better results.
