Abstract#==#Homographs, words with different meanings but the same surface form, have long
caused difficulty for machine translation systems, as it is difficult to select
the correct translation based on the context. However, with the advent of
neural machine translation (NMT) systems, which can theoretically take into
account global sentential context, one may hypothesize that this problem has
been alleviated. In this paper, we first provide empirical evidence that
existing NMT systems in fact still have significant problems in properly
translating ambiguous words. We then proceed to describe methods, inspired by
the word sense disambiguation literature, that model the context of the input
word with context-aware word embeddings that help to differentiate the word
sense before feeding it into the encoder. Experiments on three language pairs
demonstrate that such models improve the performance of NMT systems both in
terms of BLEU score and in the accuracy of translating homographs.
