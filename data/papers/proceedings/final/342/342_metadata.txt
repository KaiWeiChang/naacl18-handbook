Abstract#==#Although neural tensor networks (NTNs) have been successful in many NLP tasks,
they require a large number of parameters to be estimated, which often leads to
overfitting and a long training time. We address these issues by applying
eigendecomposition to each slice matrix of a tensor to reduce its number of paramters.
First, we evaluate our proposed NTN models on knowledge graph completion.
Second, we extend the models to recursive NTNs (RNTNs) and evaluate them on
logical reasoning tasks. These experiments show that our proposed models learn
better and faster than the original (R)NTNs.
