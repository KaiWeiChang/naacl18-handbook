Abstract#==#Structured data summarization involves generation of natural language summaries
from structured input data. In this work, we consider summarizing structured
data occurring in the form of tables as they are prevalent across a wide
variety of domains. We formulate the standard table summarization problem,
which deals with tables conforming to a single predefined schema. To this end,
we propose a mixed hierarchical attention based encoder-decoder model which is
able to leverage the structure in addition to the content of the tables. Our
experiments on the publicly available weathergov dataset show around 18 BLEU
(around 30%) improvement over the current state-of-the-art.
