Abstract#==#An essential aspect to understanding narratives is to grasp the interaction
between characters in a story and the actions they take. We examine whether
computational models can capture this interaction, when both character
attributes and actions are expressed as complex natural language descriptions.
We propose role-playing games as a testbed for this problem, and introduce a
large corpus of game transcripts collected from online discussion forums. Using
neural language models which combine character and action descriptions from
these stories, we show that we can learn the latent ties. Action sequences are
bet- ter predicted when the character performing the action is also taken into
account, and vice versa for character attributes.
