Abstract#==#We combine a neural image captioner with a Rational Speech Acts (RSA) model to
make a system that is pragmatically informative: its objective is to produce
captions that are not merely true but also distinguish their inputs from
similar images. Previous attempts to combine RSA with neural image captioning
require an inference which normalizes over the entire set of possible
utterances. This poses a serious problem of efficiency, previously solved by
sampling a small subset of possible utterances. We instead solve this problem
by implementing a version of RSA which operates at the level of characters
("a", "b", "c", ...) during the unrolling of the caption. We find that the
utterance-level effect of referential captions can be obtained with only
character-level decisions. Finally, we introduce an automatic method for
testing the performance of pragmatic speaker models, and show that our model
outperforms a non-pragmatic baseline as well as a word-level RSA captioner.
