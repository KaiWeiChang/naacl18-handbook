Abstract#==#Most real world language problems require learning from heterogenous corpora, raising the problem of learning robust models which generalise well to both similar (\emph{in domain}) and dissimilar (\emph{out of domain}) instances to those seen in training.
This requires learning an underlying task, while not learning irrelevant signals and biases specific to individual domains.
We propose a novel method to optimise both in- and out-of-domain accuracy based on joint learning of a structured neural model with domain-specific and domain-general components, coupled with adversarial training for domain.
Evaluating on multi-domain language identification and multi-domain sentiment analysis, we show substantial improvements over standard domain adaptation techniques, and domain-adversarial training.
