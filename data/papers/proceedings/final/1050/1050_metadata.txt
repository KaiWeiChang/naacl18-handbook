Abstract#==#This paper presents models to predict event durations. We introduce aspectual
features that capture deeper linguistic information than previous work, and
experiment with neural networks. Our analysis shows that tense, aspect and
temporal structure of the clause provide useful clues, and that an LSTM
ensemble captures relevant context around the event.
