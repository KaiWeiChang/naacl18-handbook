Abstract#==#We introduce a new type of deep contextualized word representation that models
both (1) complex characteristics of word use (e.g., syntax and semantics), and
(2) how these uses vary across linguistic contexts (i.e., to model polysemy).
Our word vectors are learned functions of the internal states of a deep
bidirectional language model (biLM), which is pre-trained on a large text
corpus.  We show that these representations can be easily added to existing
models and significantly improve the state of the art across six challenging
NLP problems, including question answering, textual entailment and sentiment
analysis. We also present an analysis showing that exposing the deep internals
of the pre-trained network is crucial, allowing downstream models to mix
different types of semi-supervision signals.
