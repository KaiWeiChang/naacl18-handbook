Abstract#==#Entity recognition is a widely benchmarked task in natural language processing
due to its massive applications. The state-of-the-art solution applies a neural
architecture named BiLSTM-CRF to model the language sequences. In this paper,
we propose an entity recognition system that improves this neural architecture
with two novel techniques. The first technique is Multi-Task Data Selection,
which ensures the consistency of data distribution and labeling guidelines
between source and target datasets. The other one is constrained decoding using
knowledge base. The decoder of the model operates at the document level, and
leverages global and external information sources to further improve
performance. Extensive experiments have been conducted to show the advantages
of each technique. Our system achieves state-of-the-art results on the English
entity recognition task in KBP 2017 official evaluation, and it also yields
very strong results in other languages.
