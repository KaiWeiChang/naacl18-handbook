Abstract#==#We present the first neural poetry translation system. Unlike previous works
that often fail to produce any translation for fixed rhyme and rhythm patterns,
our system always translates a source text to an English poem. Human evaluation
of the translations ranks the quality as acceptable $78.2\%$ of the time.
