Abstract#==#Implicit arguments are not syntactically connected to their predicates, and are
therefore hard to extract. Previous work has used models with large numbers of
features, evaluated on very small datasets. We propose to train models for
implicit argument prediction on a simple cloze task, for which data can be
generated automatically at scale. This allows us to use a neural model, which
draws on narrative coherence and entity salience for predictions. We show that
our model has superior performance on both synthetic and natural data.
