Abstract#==#We argue that semantic meanings of a sentence
or clause can not be interpreted independently
from the rest of a paragraph, or independently
from all discourse relations and the overall
paragraph-level discourse structure. With the
goal of improving implicit discourse relation
classification, we introduce a paragraph-level
neural networks that model inter-dependencies
between discourse units as well as discourse
relation continuity and patterns, and predict a
sequence of discourse relations in a paragraph.
Experimental results show that our model outperforms
the previous state-of-the-art systems
on the benchmark corpus of PDTB.
