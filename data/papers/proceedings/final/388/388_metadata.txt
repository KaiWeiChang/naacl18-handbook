Abstract#==#We combine multi-task learning and semi-supervised learning by inducing a joint
embedding space between disparate label spaces and learning transfer functions
between label embeddings, enabling us to jointly leverage unlabelled data and
auxiliary, annotated datasets. We evaluate our approach on a variety of tasks
with disparate label spaces. We outperform strong single and multi-task
baselines and achieve a new state of the art for aspect-based and topic-based
sentiment analysis.
