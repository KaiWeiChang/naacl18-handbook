Abstract#==#Most current models of word representations (e.g., GloVe) have successfully captured fine-
grained semantics. However, semantic similarity exhibited in these word embeddings is not suitable for resolving bridging anaphora, which requires the knowledge of associative
similarity (i.e., relatedness) instead of semantic similarity information between synonyms
or hypernyms. We create word embeddings (embeddings_PP) to capture such relatedness
by exploring the syntactic structure of noun phrases. We demonstrate that using embeddings _PP alone achieves around 30% of accuracy for bridging anaphora resolution on the ISNotes corpus. Furthermore, we achieve a substantial gain over the state-of-the-art system (Hou et al., 2013b) for bridging antecedent selection.
