Abstract#==#Peer reviewing is a central component
in the scientific publishing process. We
present the first public dataset of scientific
peer reviews available for research purposes
(PeerRead v1),1 providing an opportunity
to study this important artifact. The
dataset consists of 14.7K paper drafts and
the corresponding accept/reject decisions
in top-tier venues including ACL, NIPS
and ICLR. The dataset also includes 10.7K
textual peer reviews written by experts for
a subset of the papers. We describe the data
collection process and report interesting observed
phenomena in the peer reviews. We
also propose two novel NLP tasks based
on this dataset and provide simple baseline
models. In the first task, we show that
simple models can predict whether a paper
is accepted with up to 21% error reduction
compared to the majority baseline. In
the second task, we predict the numerical
scores of review aspects and show that simple
models can outperform the mean baseline
for aspects with high variance such as
‘originality’ and ‘impact’.
