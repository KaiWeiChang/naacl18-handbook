Abstract#==#Neuropsychological examinations are an important screening tool for the
presence of cognitive conditions (e.g. Alzheimer's, Parkinson's Disease), and
require a trained tester to conduct the exam through spoken interactions with
the subject. While audio is relatively easy to record, it remains a challenge
to automatically diarize (who spoke when?), decode (what did they say?), and
assess a subject's cognitive health. This paper demonstrates a method to
determine the cognitive health (impaired or not) of 92 subjects, from audio
that was diarized using an automatic speech recognition system trained on TED
talks and on the structured language used by testers and subjects. Using
leave-one-out cross validation and logistic regression modeling we show that
even with noisily decoded data (81% WER) we can still perform accurate enough
diarization (0.02% confusion rate) to determine the cognitive state of a
subject (0.76 AUC).
