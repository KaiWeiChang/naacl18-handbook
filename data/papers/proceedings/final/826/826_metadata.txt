Abstract#==#Cross-lingual information retrieval (CLIR) is a document retrieval task where
the documents are written in a language different from that of the user's
query. This is a challenging problem for data-driven approaches due to the
general lack of labeled training data. We introduce a large-scale dataset
derived from Wikipedia to support CLIR research in 25 languages.  Further, we
present a simple yet effective neural learning-to-rank model that shares
representations across languages and reduces the data requirement. This model
can exploit training data in, for example, Japanese-English CLIR to improve the
results of Swahili-English CLIR.
