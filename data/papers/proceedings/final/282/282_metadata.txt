Abstract#==#Millions of conversations are generated every day on social media platforms.
With limited attention, it is challenging for users to select which discussions
they would like to participate in. Here we propose a new method for microblog
conversation recommendation. While much prior work has focused on post-level
recommendation, we exploit both the conversational context, and user content
and behavior preferences. We propose a statistical model that jointly captures:
(1) topics for representing user interests and conversation content, and (2)
discourse modes for describing user replying behavior and conversation
dynamics. Experimental results on two Twitter datasets demonstrate that our
system outperforms methods that only model content without considering
discourse.
