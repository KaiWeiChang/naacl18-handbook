Abstract#==#We propose a process for investigating the extent
to which sentence representations arising
from neural machine translation (NMT) systems
encode distinct semantic phenomena. We
use these representations as features to train a
natural language inference (NLI) classifier based
on datasets recast from existing semantic
annotations. In applying this process to a representative
NMT system, we find its encoder
appears most suited to supporting inferences
at the syntax-semantics interface, as compared
to anaphora resolution requiring world knowledge.
We conclude with a discussion on
the merits and potential deficiencies of the
existing process, and how it may be improved
and extended as a broader framework for evaluating
semantic coverage
