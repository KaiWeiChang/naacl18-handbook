Abstract#==#Most modern approaches to computing word embeddings assume the
  availability of text corpora with billions of words. In this paper,
  we explore a setup where only corpora with millions of words are
  available, and many words in any new text are out of vocabulary.
  This setup is both of practical interests -- modeling the situation
  for specific domains and low-resource languages -- and of
  psycholinguistic interest, since it corresponds much more closely to
  the actual experiences and challenges of human language learning and
  use. We compare standard skip-gram word embeddings with
  character-based embeddings on word relatedness
  prediction. Skip-grams excel on large corpora, while character-based
  embeddings do well on small corpora generally and rare and complex
  words specifically. The models can be combined easily.
