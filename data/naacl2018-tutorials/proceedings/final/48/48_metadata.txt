Abstract#==#In today's information-based society, there is abundant knowledge out there
carried in the form of natural language texts (e.g., news articles, social
media posts, scientific publications), which spans across various domains
(e.g., corporate documents, advertisements, legal acts, medical reports), which
grows at an astonishing rate. Yet this knowledge is mostly inaccessible to
computers and overwhelming for human experts to absorb. How to turn such
massive and unstructured text data into structured, actionable knowledge, and
furthermore, how to teach machines learn to reason and complete the extracted
knowledge is a grand challenge to the research community. 

Traditional IE systems assume abundant human annotations for training high
quality machine learning models, which is impractical when trying to deploy IE
systems to a broad range of domains, settings and languages.  

In the first part of the tutorial, we introduce how to extract structured facts
(i.e., entities and their relations for types of interest) from text corpora to
construct knowledge bases, with a focus on methods that are weakly-supervised
and domain-independent for timely knowledge base construction across various
application domains.

In the second part, we introduce how to leverage other knowledge, such as the
distributional statistics of characters and words, the annotations for other
tasks and other domains, and the linguistics and problem structures, to combat
the problem of inadequate supervision, and conduct low-resource information
extraction.

In the third part, we describe recent advances in knowledge base reasoning. We
start with the gentle introduction to the literature, focusing on path-based
and embedding based methods. We then describe DeepPath, a recent attempt of
using deep reinforcement learning to combine the best of both worlds for
knowledge base reasoning.
