Abstract#==#As language technologies have become increasingly prevalent, there is a growing
awareness that decisions we make about our data, methods, and tools are often
tied up with their impact on people and societies. This tutorial will provide
an overview of real-world applications of language technologies and the
potential ethical implications associated with them. We will discuss
philosophical foundations of ethical research along with state of the art
techniques. Through this tutorial, we intend to provide the NLP researcher with
an overview of tools to ensure that the data, algorithms, and models that they
build are socially responsible. These tools will include a checklist of common
pitfalls that one should avoid (e.g., demographic bias in data collection), as
well as methods to adequately mitigate these issues (e.g., adjusting sampling
rates or de-biasing through regularization). The tutorial is based on a new
course on Ethics and NLP developed at Carnegie Mellon University.
