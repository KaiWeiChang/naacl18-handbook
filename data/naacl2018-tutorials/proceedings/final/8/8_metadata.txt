Abstract#==#Incorporating linguistic, world and common sense knowledge into AI/NLP systems
is currently an important research area, with several open problems and
challenges. At the same time, processing and storing this knowledge in lexical
resources is not a straightforward task. We propose to address these
complementary goals from two methodological perspectives: the use of NLP
methods to help the process of constructing and enriching lexical resources and
the use of lexical resources for improving NLP applications. This tutorial may
be useful for two main types of audience: those working on language resources
who are interested in becoming acquainted with automatic NLP techniques, with
the end goal of speeding and/or easing up the process of resource curation; and
on the other hand, researchers in NLP who would like to benefit from the
knowledge of lexical resources to improve their systems and models.
