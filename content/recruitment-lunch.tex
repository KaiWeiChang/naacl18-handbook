\noindent The Recruitment Lunch is meant for senior graduate students seeking to make employment connections with our conference sponsors and others.  Join us for a free lunch on Saturday, June 2nd, at 12:30, in the Elite Hall A at the hotel. Entrance tickets will be included in your registration materials or, if not a student, you may sign up to attend this event at the registration desk (our limit is 400 people + Recruiters). Get to know others who share similar interests and goals and may become your lifelong colleagues.
