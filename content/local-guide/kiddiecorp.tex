\chapter{On-Site Childcare and Nursing Room}


For the first time ever, ACL will be offering on-site childcare at the conference hotel by advanced reservation or walk-in.   Walk-ins are subject to availability, but there should be plenty of space, so please bring your kids!  The cost of the childcare is partially subsidized by the ACL. The cost for general registrants will be \$10 USD per hour per child. For students registrants the cost will be \$5 USD per hour per child.

The childcare rooms are Oak 1 and 2 Rooms, located across from The Stanley Park Ballroom (Salons 1-3). The care is available for children 6 months to 12 years old from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. during the main conference, and  9 a.m. to 5 p.m. on the tutorials and workshop days. The carer givers are from a professional childcare company, KiddieCorp, all of whom are CPR/first aid certified and with child care experience. The childcare has activities and play materials such as arts and crafts as well as appropriate toys for babies as well as a quiet area for napping.  

We also have the Arbutus Room available for nursing mothers with a fridge is available on request. Please stop by the registration desk to schedule time and for the key.

In addition to childcare, we invite you to bring your children, spouses and loved ones to the social event at the conference. You can purchase additional meals or additional tickets to the social event for your family members. The social event for this year is an evening at the Vancouver Aquarium Marine. It's a family friendly venue, and we hope to see you and your family there!

\paragraph{Example activities - A Pirate's Life For Me}

\includegraphics{content/local-guide/pirate_resized.pdf}

Yo, Ho, Ho, Mateys! It's a pirate's life for us. We'll have a swashbuckling good time when we discover the KiddieCorp pirate life. Alrighty buccaneers, let's dress the part; grab an eye patch, pirate hat or handkerchief and we'll set sail with a serious game of Battleship.
Before we head back to the mainland, we'll have an opportunity to create a pirate ship of our own out of Popsicle sticks at the arts and crafts station. We can also make pirate flags, treasure maps and our own beaded treasures. So let's raise the sails and get ready to have an adventure on the high seas, KiddieCorp pirate style.
