{\bfseries Abstract:} The computational linguistics and natural language processing community is experiencing an episode of deep fascination with representation learning.  Like many other presenters at this conference, I will describe new ways to use representation learning in models of natural language.  Noting that a data-driven model always assumes a theory (not necessarily a good one), I will argue for the benefits of language-appropriate inductive bias for representation-learning-infused models of language.  Such bias often comes in the form of assumptions baked into a model, constraints on an inference algorithm, or linguistic analysis applied to data.  Indeed, many decades of research in linguistics (including computational linguistics) put our community in a strong position to identify promising inductive biases.  The new models, in turn, may allow us to explore previously unavailable forms of bias, and to produce findings of interest to linguistics.  I will focus on new models of documents and of sentential semantic structures, and I will emphasize abstract, reusable components and their assumptions rather than applications.

{\bfseries Biography:} Noah Smith is an Associate Professor in the Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Washington. Previously, he was an Associate Professor in the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University. He received his Ph.D. in Computer Science from Johns Hopkins University and his B.S. in Computer Science and B.A. in Linguistics from the University of Maryland. His research spans many topics in natural language processing, machine learning, and computational social science.  He has served on the editorial boards of CL, JAIR, and TACL, as the secretary-treasurer of SIGDAT (2012–2015), and as program co-chair of ACL 2016. Alumni of his research group, Noah’s ARK, are international leaders in NLP in academia and industry. Smith’s work has been recognized with a UW Innovation award, a Finmeccanica career development chair at CMU, an NSF CAREER award, a Hertz Foundation graduate fellowship, numerous best paper nominations and awards, and coverage by NPR, BBC, CBC, the New York Times, the Washington Post, and Time.
