This paper describes the system we submitted to Task 10 (Capturing Discriminative Attributes) in SemEval 2018. Given a triple (word1, word2, attribute), this task is to predict whether it exemplifies a semantic difference or not. We design and investigate several word embedding features, PMI features and WordNet features together with supervised machine learning methods to address this task. Officially released results show that our system ranks above average.
