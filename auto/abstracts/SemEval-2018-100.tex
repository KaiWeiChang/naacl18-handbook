This paper describes our system implementation for subtask V-oc of SemEval-2018 Task 1: affect in tweets. We use multi-task learning method to learn shared representation, then learn the features for each task. There are five classification models in the proposed multi-task learning approach. These classification models are trained sequentially to learn different features for different classification tasks. In addition to the data released for SemEval-2018, we use datasets from previous SemEvals during system construction. Our Pearson correlation score is 0.638 on the official SemEval-2018 Task 1 test set.
