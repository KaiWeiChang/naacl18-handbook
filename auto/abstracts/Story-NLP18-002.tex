We examine an emerging NLP application that supports creative writing by automatically suggesting continuing sentences in a story. The application tracks users' modifications to generated sentences, which can be used to quantify their ``helpfulness'' in advancing the story. We explore the task of predicting helpfulness based on automatically detected linguistic features of the suggestions. We illustrate this analysis on a set of user interactions with the application using an initial selection of features relevant to story generation.
