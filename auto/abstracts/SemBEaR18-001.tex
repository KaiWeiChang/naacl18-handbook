We describe a novel method for identifying hedge terms using a set of manually constructed rules. We present experiments adding hedge features to a committed belief system to improve classification. We compare performance of this system (a) without hedging features, (b) with dictionary-based features, and (c) with rule-based features. We find that using hedge features improves performance of the committed belief system, particularly in identifying instances of non-committed belief and reported belief.
