Emojis  are  widely  used  on  social  media  andunderstanding their meaning is important forboth practical purposes (e.g.  opinion mining,sentiment detection) and theoretical purposes(e.g.  how different L1 speakers use them, dothey have some syntax?); this paper presents aset of experiments that aim to predict a singleemoji from a tweet.   We built different mod-els and we found that the test results are verydifferent from the validation results.
