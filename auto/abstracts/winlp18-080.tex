We described the construction of an NLI/RTE corpus for Portuguese, SICK-PT, which is based on and aligned to SICK. We focused on linguistic strategies to guarantee (i.) the reuse of original NLI/relatedness labels of SICK into SICK-PT; (ii.) a natural register of Portuguese and (iii.) having the same linguistic phenomena found in SICK.
