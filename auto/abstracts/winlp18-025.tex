In this paper we propose a model to learn joint representations for images and sentences in different languages, with the aim of advancing multilingual versions of image search and image understanding. Our model learns a common representations for images and their descriptions in two different languages (which need not be parallel) by considering the image as a bridge between two languages. We evaluate our models on image-description ranking for German and English.
