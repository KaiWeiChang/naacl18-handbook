In this study an attempt is made to optimize the output of Amharic speech recognizer using n-gram based post-edit algorithm without human intervention. Experimental result shows that the integration of post-editing algorithm with the recognizer improve the accuracy of recognition. Now we are working towards connecting the optimized speech recognition to Amharic-English speech translation.
