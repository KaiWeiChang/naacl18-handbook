This paper describes the KLUEnicorn system submitted to the SemEval-2018 task on ``Irony detection in English tweets''. The proposed system uses a naive Bayes classifier to exploit rather simple lexical, pragmatical and semantical features as well as sentiment. It further takes a closer look at different adverb categories and named entities and factors in word-embedding information.
