We firstly use GloVe to learn the distributed representations automatically from the instance, question and answer triples. Then an attentionbased Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) model is used to encode the triples. We also perform a simple ensemble method to improve the effectiveness of our model. The system we developed obtains an encouraging result on this task. It achieves the accuracy 0.7472 on the test set. We rank 5th according to the official ranking.
