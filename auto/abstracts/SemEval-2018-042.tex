The paper describes our search for a universal algorithm of detecting intentional lexical ambiguity in different forms of creative language. At SemEval-2018 Task 3, we used PunFields, the system of automatic analysis of English puns that we introduced at SemEval-2017, to detect irony in tweets. Preliminary tests showed that it can reach the score of F1=0.596. However, at the competition, its result was F1=0.549.
