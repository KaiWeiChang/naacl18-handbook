The paper describes our submissions to task 3 in SemEval-2018. There are two subtasks: Subtask A is a binary classification task to determine whether a tweet is ironic, and Subtask B is a fine-grained classification task including four classes. To address them, we explored supervised machine learning method alone and in combination with neural networks.
