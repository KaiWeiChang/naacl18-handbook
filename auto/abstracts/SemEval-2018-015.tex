This paper describes the system used and results obtained for team FOI DSS at SemEval-2018 Task 1: Affect In Tweets. The team participated in all English language subtasks, with a method utilizing transfer learning from LSTM nets trained on large sentiment datasets combined with embeddings and lexical features. For four out of five subtasks, the system performed in the range of 92-95\% of the winning systems, in terms of the competition metrics. Analysis of the results suggests that improved pre-processing and addition of more lexical features may further elevate performance.
