Written communication lacks the multimodal features such as posture, gesture and gaze that make it easy to model affective states. Especially in social media such as Twitter, due to the space constraints, the sources of informa- tion that can be mined are even more limited due to character limitations. These limitations constitute a challenge for understanding short social media posts. In this paper, we present an approach that utilizes multiple binary classifiers that represent different affective categories to model Twit- ter posts (e.g., tweets). We train domain- independent recurrent neural network models without any outside information such as affect lexicons. We then use these domain independent binary ranking models to eval- uate the applicability of such deep learning models on the affect identification task. This approach allows different model architectures and parameter settings for each affect category instead of building one single multi-label classifier. The contributions of this paper are two-folds: we show that modeling tweets with a small training set is possible with the use of RNNs and we also prove that formulating affect identification as a binary classification task is highly effective.
