Named Entities Recognition (NER) is one of the most challenging tasks in Natural Language Processing. This task was usually done by the state-of-the-art techniques such as Support Vector Machine and Conditional Random Fields. This paper investigated an application of neural network-based approach to recognize named entities in low-resource language, with application on Vietnamese. We constructed a bidirectional neural network-based model with the additional information from a pre-trained word embedding model to better recognize new named entities, which did not appear in the training data. The experiments showed our proposed approach outperformed the state-of-the-art models with the significant gains of F1 score.
