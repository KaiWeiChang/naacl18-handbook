This paper discusses SemEval-2018 Task 5: a referential quantification task of counting events and participants in local, long-tail news documents with high ambiguity. The complexity of this task challenges systems to establish the meaning, reference and identity across documents. The task consists of three subtasks and spans across three domains. We detail the design of this referential quantification task, describe the participating systems, and present additional analysis to gain deeper insight into their performance.
