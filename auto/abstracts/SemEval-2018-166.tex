This paper describes the IUCM entry at SemEval-2018 Task 11, on machine comprehension using commonsense knowledge. First, clustering and topic modeling are used to divide given texts into topics. Then, during the answering phase, other texts of the same topic are retrieved and used as commonsense knowledge. Finally, the answer is selected. While clustering itself shows good results, finding an answer proves to be more challenging. This paper reports the results of system evaluation and suggests potential improvements.
