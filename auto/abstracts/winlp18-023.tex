Speakers adapt their speaking style to match that of their interlocutor in a process described as linguistic entrainment or accommodation. While previous studies have considered the entrainment of acoustic-prosodic features in spoken dialogue, the entrainment of phonation has not been examined. Using a hand-annotated and automatically classified dataset of phonation labels, I examine the entrainment of creaky voice in partners over several dimensions. I additionally consider how speaker and partner gender affect both rates of creak and entrainment in a cooperative dialogue.
