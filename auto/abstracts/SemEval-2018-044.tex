Character identification is an entity-linking task that finds words referring to the same person among the nouns mentioned in a conversation and turns them into one entity. In this paper, we define a sequence-labeling problem to solve character identification, and propose an attention-based recurrent neural network (RNN) encoder---decoder model. The in-put document for character identification on multiparty dialogues consists of several conversations, which increase the length of the input sequence. The RNN encoder---decoder model suffers from poor performance when the length of the input sequence is long. To solve this problem, we propose applying position encoding and the self-matching network to the RNN encoder---decoder model. Our experimental results demonstrate that of the four models proposed, Model 2 showed an F1 score of 86.00\% and a label accuracy of 85.10\% at the scene-level.
