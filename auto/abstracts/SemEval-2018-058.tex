This paper describes the participation of ELiRF-UPV team at task 11, Machine Comprehension using Commonsense Knowledge, of SemEval-2018. Our approach is based on the use of word embeddings, NumberBatch Embeddings, and a Deep Learning architecture to find the best answer for the multiple-choice questions based on the narrative text. The results obtained are in line with those obtained by the other participants and they encourage us to continue working on this problem.
