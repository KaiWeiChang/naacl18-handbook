This paper describes our participation in Affec- tive Tweets task for emotional intensity and senti- ment intensity subtasks for English, Spanish, and Arabic languages. We used two approaches, Î¼TC and EvoMSA. The first one is a generic text cate- gorization and regression system; and the second one, a two-stage architecture for Sentiment Analy- sis. Both approaches are multilingual and domain independent.
