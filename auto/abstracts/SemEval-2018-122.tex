We implemented the sentiment system in all five subtasks for English and Spanish. All subtasks involve emotion or sentiment intensity prediction (regression and ordinal classification) and emotions determining (multi-labels classification). The useful BiLSTM (Bidirectional Long-Short Term Memory) model with attention mechanism was mainly applied for our system. We use BiLSTM in order to get word information extracted from both directions. The attention mechanism was used to find the contribution of each word for improving the scores. Furthermore, based on BiLSTMATT (BiLSTM with attention mechanism) a few deep-learning algorithms were employed for different subtasks. For regression and ordinal classification tasks we used domain adaptation and ensemble learning methods to leverage base model. While a single base model was used for multi-labels task.
