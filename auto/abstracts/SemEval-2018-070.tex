This paper presents our participation for sub- task1 (1.1 and 1.2) in SemEval 2018 task 7: Semantic Relation Extraction and Classifica- tion in Scientific Papers (Ga ÃÅbor et al., 2018). We experimented on this task with two meth- ods: CNN method and traditional pipeline method. We use the context between two en- tities (included) as input information for both methods, which extremely reduce the noise effect. For the CNN method, we construct a simple convolution neural network to auto- matically learn features from raw texts with- out any manual processing. Moreover, we use the softmax function to classify the entity pair into a specific relation category. For the tradi- tional pipeline method, we use the Hackabout method as a representation which is described in section3.5. The CNN method's result is much better than traditional pipeline method (49.1\% vs. 42.3\% and 71.1\% vs. 54.6\% ).
