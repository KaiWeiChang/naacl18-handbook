This article describes the unsupervised strategy submitted by the CitiusNLP team to the SemEval 2018 Task 10, a task which consists of predict whether a word is a discriminative attribute between two other words. Our strategy relies on the correspondence between discriminative attributes and relevant contexts of a word. More precisely, the method uses transparent distributional models to extract salient contexts of words which are identified as discriminative attributes. The system performance reaches about 70\% accuracy when it is applied on the development dataset, but its accuracy goes down (63\%) on the official test dataset.
