This paper describe the system we proposed to participate the first year of Irony detection in English tweets competition. Previous works demonstrate that LSTMs models have achieved remarkable performance in natural language processing; besides, combining multiple classification from various individual classifiers in general is more powerful than a single classification. In order to obtain more precision classification of irony detection, our system trained several individual neural network classifiers and combined their results according to the ensemble-learning algorithm.
