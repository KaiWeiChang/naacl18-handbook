This paper describes our approach, called EPUTION, for the open trial of the SemEval- 2018 Task 2, Multilingual Emoji Prediction. The task relates to using social media — more precisely, Twitter — with its aim to predict the most likely associated emoji of a tweet. Our solution for this text classification prob- lem explores the idea of transfer learning for adapting the classifier based on users' tweet- ing history. Our experiments show that our user-adaption method improves classification results by more than 6 per cent on the macro- averaged F1. Thus, our paper provides evi- dence for the rationality of enriching the orig- inal corpus longitudinally with user behaviors and transferring the lessons learned from cor- responding users to specific instances.
