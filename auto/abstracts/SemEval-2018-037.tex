We present SUNNYNLP, our system for solving SemEval 2018 Task 10: ``Capturing Discriminative Attributes''. Our Support-Vector-Machine(SVM)-based system combines features extracted from pre-trained embeddings and statistical information from Is-A taxonomy to detect semantic difference of concepts pairs. Our system is demonstrated to be effective in detecting semantic difference and is ranked 1st in the competition in terms of F1 measure. The open source of our code is coined SUNNYNLP.
