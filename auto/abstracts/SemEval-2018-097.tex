In this paper we describe our submission to SemEval-2018 Task 1: Affects in Tweets. The model which we present is an ensemble of various neural architectures and gradient boosted trees, and employs three different types of vectorial tweet representations. Furthermore, our system is language-independent and ranked first in 5 out of the 12 subtasks in which we participated, while achieving competitive results in the remaining ones. Comparatively remarkable performance is observed on both the Arabic and Spanish languages.
