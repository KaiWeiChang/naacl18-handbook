Detecting sarcasm in text is a particularly challenging problem in computational semantics, and its solution may vary across different types of text.  We analyze the performance of a domain-general sarcasm detection system on datasets from two very different domains: Twitter, and Amazon product reviews.  We categorize the errors that we identify with each, and make recommendations for addressing these issues in NLP systems in the future.
