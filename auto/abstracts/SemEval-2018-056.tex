This paper describes the participation of ELiRF-UPV team at tasks 1 and 3 of Semeval-2018. We present a deep learning based system that assembles Convolutional Neural Networks and Long Short-Term Memory neural networks. This system has been used with slight modifications for the two tasks addressed both for English and Spanish. Finally, the results obtained in the competition are reported and discussed.
