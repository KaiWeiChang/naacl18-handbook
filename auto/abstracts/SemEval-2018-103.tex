This paper describes our participation in Se- mEval 2018 Task 2: Multilingual Emoji Pre- diction, in which participants are asked to pre- dict a tweet's most associated emoji from 20 emojis. Instead of regarding it as a 20-class classification problem we regard it as a text similarity problem. We propose a vector sim- ilarity based approach for this task. First the distributed representation (tweet vector) for each tweet is generated, then the similarity be- tween this tweet vector and each emoji's em- bedding is evaluated. The most similar emoji is chosen as the predicted label. Experimental results show that our approach performs com- parably with the classification approach and shows its advantage in classifying emojis with similar semantic meaning.
