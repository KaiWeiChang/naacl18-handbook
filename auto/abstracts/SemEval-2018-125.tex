An argument is divided into two parts, the claim and the reason. To obtain a clearer conclusion, some additional explanation is required. In this task, the explanations are called warrants. This paper introduces a bi-directional long short term memory (Bi-LSTM) with an attention model to select a correct warrant from two to explain an argument. We address this question as a question-answering system. For each warrant, the model produces a probability that it is correct. Finally, the system chooses the highest correct probability as the answer. Ensemble learning is used to enhance the performance of the model. Among all of the participants, we ranked 15th on the test results.
