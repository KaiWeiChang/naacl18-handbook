This paper describes our submission for the International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval-2018) shared task 11--- Machine Comprehension using Commonsense Knowledge (Ostermann et al., 2018b). We use a deep neural network model to choose the correct answer from the candidate answers pair when the document and question are given. The interactions between document, question and answers are modeled by attention mechanism and a variety of manual features are used to improve model performance. We also use CoVe (McCann et al., 2017) as an external source of knowledge which is not mentioned in the document. As a result, our system achieves 80.91\% accuracy on the test data, which is on the third place of the leaderboard.
