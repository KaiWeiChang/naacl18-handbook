We propose a novel attentive hybrid GRU-based network (SAHGN), which we used at SemEval-2018 Task 1: Affect in Tweets. Our network has two main characteristics, 1) has the ability to internally optimize its feature representation using attention mechanisms, and 2) provides a hybrid representation using a character level Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), as well as a self-attentive word-level encoder. The key advantage of our model is its ability to signify the relevant and important information that enables self-optimization. Results are reported on the valence intensity regression task.
