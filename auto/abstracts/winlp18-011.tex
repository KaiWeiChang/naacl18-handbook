This paper presents the development of Amharic Sentiment Analysis model. In this work, we completely remove the need of annotated data and propose a novel method by combining lexicon based technique with supervised machine learning. Experimental results show that the proposed combined method performs well with an accuracy of 82.5\%. Though the proposed approach does not still beat the lexicon based approach with the small data set used, it is a breakthrough in Amharic sentiment analysis, and opens exciting opportunities for future research.
