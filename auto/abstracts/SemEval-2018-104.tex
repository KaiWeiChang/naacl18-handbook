This paper describes our submissions to Task 2 in SemEval 2018, i.e., Multilingual Emoji Prediction. We first investigate several traditional Natural Language Processing (NLP) features, and then design several deep learning models. For subtask 1: Emoji Prediction in English, we combine two different methods to represent tweet, i.e., supervised model using traditional features and deep learning model. For subtask 2: Emoji Prediction in Spanish, we only use deep learning model.
