The detection and classification of domestic abuse stories shared online has ever-increasing importance in today's social activism sphere. With massive numbers of stories shared, automatic detection of these stories can help push forward the fight against domestic abuse from a social campaign to social change. We develop CNN-RNN neural models to detect domestic abuse stories in the Reddit Domestic Abuse dataset. We achieved 95.6\% accuracy in classifying posts as containing abuse stories vs. not containing abuse stories, outperforming the current state-of-the-art. More importantly, we next present interpretable and explainable analysis of the neural model predictions using activation clustering techniques to automatically discover linguistic features.
