This paper describes our NIHRIO system for SemEval-2018 Task 3 ``Irony detection in English tweets.'' We propose to use a simple neural network architecture of Multilayer Perceptron with various types of input features including: lexical, syntactic, semantic and polarity features. Our system achieves very high performance in both subtasks of binary and multi-class irony detection in tweets. In particular, we rank at least fourth using the accuracy metric and sixth using the F1 metric. Our code is available at: https://github.com/NIHRIO/IronyDetectionInTwitter
