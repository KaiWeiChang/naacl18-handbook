This paper describes the ALANIS system that participated in Task 3 of SemEval-2018. We develop a system for detection of irony, as well as the detection of three types of irony: verbal polar irony, other verbal irony, and situational irony. The system uses a logistic regression model in subtask A and a voted classifier system with manually developed features to identify ironic tweets. This model improves on a naive bayes baseline by about 8 percent on training set.
