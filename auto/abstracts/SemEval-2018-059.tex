This paper describes the system submitted to SemEval 2018 shared task 10 â€˜Capturing Dicriminative  Attributes'.   We  use  a  combination  of knowledge-based  and  co-occurrence features to capture the semantic difference between two words in relation to an attribute. We define scores based on association measures, ngram counts,  word similarity,  and ConceptNet relations.  The system is ranked 4th (joint) on the official leaderboard of the task.
